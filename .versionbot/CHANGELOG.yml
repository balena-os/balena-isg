                The tunnel to port 22222 used by testbots communicate between the core

                Run ssh from the worker to test local SSH authentication with a cloud

                Given that testbot devices use a tunnel to specific ports to communicate

                with the DUT that is established with the suite-generated keys, using

                a different keypair for the ssh-auth test would require to tear down and

                re-establish the tunnel.


                It's easier to just use the existing key pair in the ssh-auth test.

                Using two set of keys, the one created by the suite to authenticate by

                the proxy and a new custom key, is tricky as when running on testbot the

                key is used to establish the tunnel between core and DUT.


                Revert this change in preparation to removing the custom key and

                modifying the tests to use a single key.


                This reverts commit b24d92774a67cf0c0b83a29848bdcf6ed8a574db.

                There are two sets of keys used in this test, one stored in `/root/id`

                which is created by the cloud suite to SSH via the proxy server, and

                The `os-config` application stops the supervisor before fetching openvpn

                configuration and starting the `openvpn` service unit.


                As the `openvpn` service units stops `os-config`, it might not get to

                restart the supervisor.


                This commit checks that `os-config` is not already active before

                starting it.


                Fixes #2855

                The sshd daemon is configured to fetch keys from the API for local

                user connections. The script that fetches the keys, cloud-public-sshkeys,

                sources balena-config-vars and is run as an exclusive non-root user.


                Let's set the correct permissions for this file to allow not to break

                the above.


                Also, add a test to check that the SSH authentication with user

                registered keys does not break again.

                Yocto builds will abort due to inconsistencies between the pseudo

                database and files modified outside of the pseudo context [0].


                This will occasionally cause builds to fail in the do_deploy step of the

                kernel-devsrc recipe. [1]


                Fix this by not removing the kernel_source tarball in the do_deploy

                step.

                This config file hasn't been used since commit 2db88c2, which unified

                how managed and unmanaged images operate. Since that commit, openvpn

                starts up if the config file at /etc/openvpn/openvpn.conf is found, and

                otherwise remains inactive. This file is populated by os-config.


                Remove the old config to prevent misdirection and cleanup the layer.

                Chronyd checks that the directory specified as `sourcedir` in
                `chrony.conf`

                (in this case `/var/chrony`) is not world accessible if it exists (chrony

                will create it correctly if it does not exist), and does not start

                if that's the case.


                The way that the `/var/chrony` is created when it does not exist opens

                the possibility of the directory existing with the wrong permissions and

                hitting this problem.


                This commit creates the directory with the correct permissions from the

                start to avoid the race condition.


                It also changes the permissiong from 750 to 770 to match what chrony

                does (see

                The task that applies the aufs patches is still required to support

                hostOS updates between aufs and overlay2 balenaOS versions.


                This commit adds support for 5.15 kernels and improves the branch

                selection logic to cover some corner cases.


                It also adds a test task so that we can test regressions.

                The move to include the ABI in the target definition was done in Poky:

                d6b563710e6cc0857843433d85023d47f9f2037d


                Without much explanation in the commit, the ABI was removed in Poky:

                e4c16d11128f0e9cc2567fc9e3579e9a94988b2e


                Only to be re-introduced, also without much explanation in Poky:

                0bf2fd16273436f1cd9ea2ab99ad882e879f965d


                Then, there was a partial revert to remove the ABI again in Poky:

                66ff1fb3a164fa794ee186960809e3fa9e938b48


                This last 66ff1fb3a164fa794ee186960809e3fa9e938b48 commit is reverted here as

                it fails to build for ARM targets. All our boards that cover all the

                possible ABIs build with this change.

                        The 243390 device specific tests assess that the hotspot
                        connection is created on the intended interface. We thus
                        need to ensure that the connection to the testbot is
                        established using the embedded wifi chip.

                        Unfortunately the standalone balena-cli package is linked to glibc

                        and does not work with musl (alpine) so we need to switch to debian.


                        The trade-off seems worth it for build times though.

                        publish the current setting.

                Instead of querying devices w/ `fdisk -l`, glob match patterns specified

                in resin-init-flasher.conf with devices present in `/dev`. This allows us to

                specify devices like `hd? sd? mmcblk?` instead of individual device

                numbers, which don't consistently map to any particular disk.


                This also allows RAID arrays to be matched with the array name and a

                pattern that glob matches even arrays assembled automatically on a

                non-matching host, such as `md/balena?(_?)` matching an array named

                `balena` and assembled on-device at `/dev/md/balena_0`.

                These packages also install kernel images into the boot directory in the

                root partition, overwriting the initramfs kernel installed by

                kernel-image-initramfs.


                Before kirkstone, the way to not include the kernel image was to

                override the `RDEPENDS:${KERNEL_PACKAGE_NAME}-base` not to include

                `kernel-image`, as was done in the `kernel-resin-noimage` class.


                Kirkstone changes the dependency from RDEPENDS to RRECOMMENDS in

                Poky's commit f6d963fa6d0e64d53f7ef56fd2c12d67f5811829


                Now excluding the kernel image needs to `PACKAGE_EXCLUDE = "kernel-image-*"`

                The crate fetcher was introduced in bitbake in Kirkstone, before that

                it was living in meta-rust.


                We want to use the balena-rust layer across a wide variety of Yocto

                versions so include the fetcher conditionally.

                The arch_to_rust_arch() function was introduced to cater for ppc64le

                systems and is not present in older Yocto releases.


                This commit reverts to the previous way of setting the rust architecture.

                It will not work for ppc64le and if we would need to support such an

                architecture the arch_to_rust_arch() function will still be called if it

                exists in Kirkstone or newer Yocto versions.

                With Kirkstone and the support of openSSL 3.0 it's not possible to find

                a set of dependencies that work for all of our rust applications across

                the 1.32 to 1.62 toolchain versions that are supported across all the

                Yocto versions we keep compatibility with.


                This layer allows to set a preferred version as a distro setting that can

                be used across all Yocto versions.


                These rust recipes come from Poky Kirkstone

              hash: 7146e4614c2658d6f7d5384602eb8ad213e08759
              body: >
                Previously, our healthcheck verified if we were able to start a new

                container. This had two downsides:


                1. It was relatively heavyweight. In devices under heavy load, it would
                   sometimes take so long to run that the Engine was killed by the
                   watchdog.
                2. It wrote to the storage media. Creating a container involves writing
                   some data to persistent storage, therefore the healthcheck was
                   wearing the storage media.

                This new healthcheck simply pings both `balenad` and `containerd`, which

                is much faster than starting a new container and doesn't write to disk.

                The step of pinging `containerd` is important because we have seen at

                least one case in the past in which `balenad` was working but

                `containerd` wasn't.

                With `WatchdogSignal=SIGTERM` systemd will send a SIGTERM and give the

                Engine 90 seconds to gracefully shutdown before sending a SIGKILL. We

                had cases of Engine metadata on disk getting corrupted after the

                watchdog sent it a SIGKILL directly. This change shall minimize this

                issue.

                Our tests perform two HUPs (into and out of the release under test), and

                the code for both of these HUPs were duplicated. This commit factors

                this code out to a common function.

                This is a small improvement over our previous test: in addition to

                checking that the volumes themselves are preserved over HUPs, we now

                check if the contents of these volumes is preserved.


                Resolves #2428

                The boot partition is currently a FAT filesystem that does not support

                application that needs to be used both when reading and writing files

                to the boot partition to provide safe accesses.

                        The executeCommand family of methods default to retrying on failure. In

                        some cases, such as in the ssh-auth test in the cloud test suite, we

                        expect failures to happen, and want them to be raised immediately. Other

                        situations might demand adjusting the number of retries and interval to

                        fit specific tests. Add a retryOptions object to these methods to allow

                        for this behavior to be configured.

                Changing this to permanent storage trades boot times with media life

                Currently `os-config-json` is also parsing `units-conf.json` at runtime.

                This is expensive to do for smaller devices, so this commit performs the

                processing at build time.


                For this, it also splits the configuration units processing in

                balena-config-vars into its own recipe to allow for task ordering.

                Executing balena-config-vars is quite taxing for smaller devices. For

                example a RaspberryPi Zero.


                This commit introduces a cached memory file with the configuration

                environment that is recreated when `config.json` changes and will be

                used if present.

                This commit replaces BOOT_MOUNTPOINT with BALENA_BOOT_MOUNTPOINT to

                When accessing a test device as part of a fleet, a cloud API key is

                required in order to generate an SSH key and access the device through

                the VPN. However, when accessing a device locally, such as a QEMU

                instance running on the workstation itself, we have a direct path, and

                no VPN is necessary.


                Make the apiKey optional, and don't login when it's not specified. This

                allows direct connections to work without it.

                Certain chrony tests require the ability to block NTP requests. Switch

                from blocking these requests using iptables rules to simply stopping the

                local DNS server, which is faster and simpler, and doesn't conflict with

                the supervisor firewall.

                We may have cases when for some boards we do not want

                to have all these files blacklisted. See for example

                https://github.com/balena-os/balena-rockpi/commit/b5eadcfb3a296eea2554dc0cbdd16002d51c5169


                In conclusion, we rework how the blacklist is constructed

                so that users of meta-balena can alter this list as they see fit.

              hash: 9a873418d094b8b951535c52154be71f8b295c31

                This changes the condition in the unit file from checking whether

                /dev/disk/by-state/balena-efi exists to checking whether /mnt/boot/EFI

                is a symlink. The original approach has a race condition populating

                the by-state symlink - it is depending on udev and if the link is

                not present when the service is started (after the boot partition is mounted),

                the service fails and the EFI partition is never mounted.


                The new approach does the trick pretty well - /mnt/boot/EFI is a symlink

                if the EFI partition is split and a regular directory in case there is a single

                boot partition. That said the service is only started when necessary

                and the waiting for udev is implemented as a part of the mount script.

                Recent versions of GRUB default to use shim_lock when in secure boot mode.

                We do not use shim and do not build the shim_lock module into GRUB EFI binary

                therefore this needs to be disabled.

                Add a healthcheck that will check that the NTP sources are reachable

                and the system time does not skew.


                The healthcheck will command a burst sync if there is no selected

                reachable source, and will restart chronyd if the system clock skews.


                Fixes #2314

                Use systemd.waitForServiceState instead of waitUntil. This improves

                readability, and reduces the time taken in the case that the test fails

                and the default interval of waitUntil causes an excessive wait.

                When tests execute quicker, a race condition can occur where config.json

                is edited to remove the dnsServers property, but /run/dnsmasq.servers is

                not changed yet. This causes the test to fail, as the file is not empty.

                    not ok 1 - We should have an empty /run/dnsmasq.servers file.
                      ---

                Fix this by waiting until the InvocationID of dnsmasq.service changes.

                    - subject: Fix "slice bounds out of range" while applying deltas
                      hash: 6f12d0abb3e438f26a18eee9bbaeca9c4702f7e7
                      body: >
                        The root cause of this issue was an integer overflow in 32-bit platforms

                        -- specifically, when explicitly converting `io.Reader` offsets

                        (`int64`) to slice indices (`int`, which is only 32-bit long on 32-bit

                        platforms).


                        We already had in place the checks supposed to ensure slice bounds where

                        always within the expected bounds. So, in a way, this commit just

                        re-organizes the code so that we perform safely this required `int64` to

                        `int` type conversion.

                        Splash image backend would throw if the image is not a valid png during

                        the write step. This could prevent the device from provisioning if some

                        corruption happens at some point.

                        This commit updates all backends that write to /mnt/boot to do it

                        through a new `lib/host-utils` module. Writes are now done using write +

                        sync as rename is not an atomic operation in vfat.


                        The change also applies for writes through the `/v1/host-config`

                        endpoint.


                        Finally this change includes some improvements on tests.

                        The status field does not indicate the current state of the Engine on the
                        device.

                        Rather, it only indicates whether the HTTP response returned successfully or not.


                        To get the current state of the device, i.e. whether it has applied target state or not,

                        use the `appState` field in the response.

                        The linked issue describes the Supervisor not cleaning up locks it creates
                        due

                        to crashing at just the wrong time. After internal discussion we decided to

                        differentiate Supervisor-created lockfiles from user-created lockfiles by using

                        the `nobody` UID (65534) for Supervisor-created lockfiles.


                        As the existing NPM lockfile lib does not allow creating lockfiles atomically

                        with different UIDs, we move to using the lockfile binary, which is part of the

                        procmail package. To allow nonroot users to write to lock directories, permissions

                        are changed to allow write access by nonroot users.

                        dmidecode for alpine 3.11 doesn't work in this device type. This change

                        moves to using `/proc/device-tree/product-sn` and

                        `/proc/device-tree/product-name` for these devices.

                        Migration `M00008` had a bug with the check for legacy apps, which

                        resulted in devices that had at some point been updated from a single

                        container supervisor to get the error


                        ```

                        Undefined binding(s) detected when compiling UPDATE. Undefined column(s): [appUuid] query

                        ```


                        This adds a new migration with the fix to ensure broken fix the

                        inconsistent database state.

                        This change updates types and database format in order to allow

                        receiving the new format of the target state from the cloud and allow

                        applications to keep working.


                        This change also updates metadata in the containers, meaning services

                        will need to be restarted on supervisor update

                        It seems that in some cases the supervisor can report

                        an image without a `status` field leading to a cloud side 401 response.

                        See #1905 for more details.

                This solves a problem seen on a device on which, although

                timeinit-rtc finishes running before timesync-https, chronyd

                sets the system time to the incorrect rtc time

                as soon as timesync-https finished running and setting the correct date

                from the servers.

                This reverts 5047757 where we set the global DHCP timeout for ipv4 to

                infinity to mitigate problems with routers that do not respond to DHCP

                requests in time.


                This however causes issues on some routers, which after power cycle fail to

                renew leases after they are expired.


                The same ipv4.dhcp-timeout can be specified on per connection basis. Since

                the case with lease renewal due to router power cycle is a more common case,

                it is better to keep the global dhcp-timeout default unmodified. If the

                setting needs adjustment then it can be overwritten in the particular

                connection profile.

              hash: c4ce541526455c8cb891e7c76889e0d4cb2735b1
              body: >
                There are known situations in which balenaEngine times out during

                initialization (for example, during aufs to overlayfs migrations, or

                when restarting a device that was running a large number of containers).

                When these time outs occur, Systemd kills the Engine, causing further

                problems.


                To avoid these cases, this commit disables timeouts during the Engine

                initialization.


                This is also aligned with the default Systemd settings distributed with

                the Moby project.

                        This adds two new integration tests:


                        * TestDeltaSize: this is meant to catch regressions on delta sizes. It
                          generates deltas and compare their sizes with the delta sizes we get
                          as of now. If the size increases, the test fails.
                        * TestDeltaCorrectness: checks if applying a delta indeed results in the
                          same image as we had originally.

                        A number of different test cases (different images with distinct

                        features) are tested for each of these integration tests.

                Starting with v2.91.6 device provisioning will not start if the device

                was unable to register in the cloud due to lack of internet connectivity.

                To avoid this, we switch to retrying 3 times with the usual 2 second delay

                between attempts, after which the flashing process will start.

                Let's ensure tools like fixdep are built in container
                and not reused from the yocto build, otherwise they
                may not run if they were linked against a different
                version of libc that may not be available in the kernel
                modules build container.

                This fixes the following error encountered when doing
                a Poky Honister build for the balena-intel repository:

                This was originally introduced in combination with a kernel patch
                backported

                from Red Hat kernel that would enable kernel lockdown when secure boot

                is enabled. We have since changed the approach, dropped the kernel patch

                and when in secure boot mode use a different GRUB config file that enables

                lockdown on kernel command line unconditionally.


                That said, while the patch works fine, we do not really need it and it adds

                extra overhead porting it to newer yocto versions so there is no point keeping

                it at this moment. If in the future there is need for the kernel to know

                whether it is in secure boot mode or not, we can roll this back and rebase.

                In most cases there is not enough space on rootfs to extract

                and load a local hostapp image when the balena-host tmpdir

                is on the same partition.


                This uses a data mount to ensure temporary extracted files of the

                compressed image will not fill the target sysroot.

                Providing the image name in the command line provides an update path

                for unmanaged devices, manual updates on ESR devices (which currently

                do not allow dashboard based updates) and openBalena use cases.

                Since
                https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/commit/1eee36a5520b5a89fb4d0d6af6f9cb0217a3164f

                was merged and included in kernel versions after 5.10.84,

                building the kernel-modules-headers fails due to various missing

                headers from the gmp and mpc packages. This problem is visible

                only after upgrading to a newer kernel, because until now the

                gcc plugins kernel config was not enabled at all, due to the

                failed check in the above mentioned patch.


                Since we are not using the functions provided

                by the gcc plugins anyway, we can disable this

                config.

                In the current state the by-state symlink for balena-efi partition

                is not generated for two reasons:

                - 60-resin-update-state.rules only react to resin-* partition names

                - the root device is not identified correctly in resin_update_state_probe
                  for LUKS devices

                This patch fixes both the issues and makes use of the by-state symlink

                instead of by-label.

                This patch adds the check for PCRs

                - 0 - firmware/UEFI blob

                - 1 - firmware/UEFI config

                - 2 - Expansion card firmware blobs

                - 3 - Expansion card firmware configs


                The full protection is only applied on first boot after provisioning,

                flasher only locks against PCRs 0, 2 and 3.

                This is because when using flasher, the environment is not in the same

                state as the one we want to lock to. In particular the boot order is

                different (flasher is booted from a different drive than the resulting OS).

                As for now we were not able to find a better solution than fully locking

                only on first boot. This means the device must be booted in a secure

                environment at least once after provisioning.

                        The moby engine v20.x.y adds some selinux [security
                        configurations](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration)

                        depending on the [container configuration](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/daemon/create.go#L214).

                        This would cause the supervisor to enter a service restart loop as the

                        current and target service configurations will never match. The

                        supervisor now ignores selinux specific security options since those are

                        not supported by balenaOS.

                        previously switch would treat S_IFIFO and S_IFSOCK as the same, passing

                        the socket, we instead handle socket separately.


                        Also adds cases for this to the unit and integration tests of the

                        migrator.

                        This commit changes the way we retry layer downloads after failures with

                        the goal of making it more resilient, especially for cases involving

                        large layers and unreliable network connections.


                        These are the changes:


                        * Make sure we also retry after failures in `v2LayerDescriptor.reset()`.
                          This method creates a new HTTP request to resume a failed download,
                          and therefore depends on a working network to succeed.
                        * Wait exponentially longer times between retries (instead of retrying
                          immediately as before). This shall increase of success in case of
                          network issues that take longer to get resolved.
                        * Increase the number of retries to 10.

                        * Reset retry count whenever we successfully download anything at all.
                          The idea is that we want to give up downloading only after a long
                          continuous period of failures. Combined with the exponential back-off
                          strategy and increased number of retries described above, a layer pull
                          will fail only after about 17 minutes.
                        * Add a bit more logging to help with troubleshooting.

                        Busybox in balenaOS is compiled with desktop mode disabled,

                        so features like `-ef` and providing pids via `-q` are not

                        supported. Add a 3rd condition to try ps with no args and allow

                        parsePSOutput to filter by pid.

                        Earlier engine versions were not properly persisting cacheID

                        in layer metadata. As a result, because of abruptly terminated transactions,

                        a lot of devices have unreferenced graphdriver layers on disk.


                        With this change, the engine will be able to clean up such unreferenced layers.

                        Such data is now identified before any new transactions can be created,

                        and a background process is started to delete both meta data and graph driver layeres.

                        If the engine process is terminated during the layer extraction
                        transaction,

                        before Commit or Cancel is called on the transaction, a new FS layer can be created

                        by the graph driver without any link to the layers metadata.


                        This change ensures we don't perform any actions on the graph driver storage until

                        the FS layer ID (the cacheID) is  persisted as a part of the transaction data.


                        We can use this data to clean up the graph driver storage on next process start

                        deleting all data associated with the transactions terminated abruptly.

                The prepare-openvpn service needs to be restarted to regenerate the

                VPN keys when provisioning is finished and the `apiKey` is removed.


                Note that flasher images make changes to `/mnt/boottmp/config.json` so

                we still need to manually kick `prepare-openvpn` in

                `resin-device-register`, which is preferable to modifying services to

                watch multiple paths.

                the Pi4 and CM4 and switched to using it
                from overlay-map, however, we were not aware
                of this.

                Let's add a vcdbg testcase to warn in case the RPi
                firmware fails to load any overlay or dtb, and set
                gpu_mem to 64 so that vcdbg can run.

              hash: 13cf7c9fef0a6e0df6b042ba34ceaa7a0d005254

                We want the VPN to start unconditionally even if the connectivity URL

                is not reachable.


                The rationale for adding the dependency in the first place was that

                without an initial timesync certificate checks may fail. This can still

                happen, but the VPN will retry continuously and eventually succeed once

                the time is synched.


                What happens now is that the VPN is delayed until the http sync, so if

                the connectivity URL is blocked or unreachable, but the internet is

                accessible, VPN will not even launch and no remote debugging is possible.

                This causes a burst of service restarts each time config.json changes,

                We add this this check since we discovered
                that with newer boot firmware the Pi4 will
                not reboot when under-voltage is reported.

                We don't mark the test as failed in
                this case, since there may be devices that
                continue to work even if under-powered and we
                don't want to block or delay development if the
                DUT is remote and cannot be checked or replaced
                easily.

                This check provides an indication for further
                debugging of failed test cases.

                After moving the partition resizing code to execute on each boot,

                we made it unreachable on first boot. We must not exit the script

                after resizing the partition only because that way the resizing

                is only finished on 2nd boot.

                When resizing the filesystem fails, such as when resize2fs won't touch

                it because it's dirty, the partition gets resized, but not the

                filesystem. The script will not attempt to resize the filesystem again,

                as it detects the partition has already been resized.


                Split these actions apart, so that the filesystem resize is always

                attempted. If resize2fs detects that the filesystem is already filling

                available space, it will exit with no action taken.

                Let's only apply this code to pre-warrior as intended. Starting
                with warrior this code is in poky so we can rely on it from
                there instead of keeping a duplicate in meta-balena-common.
                This helps with BSPs that may define their own tasks (configure,
                compile and so on) for u-boot (keeping this fragments merging
                code in meta-balena-common would have the effect of overwriting
                these tasks from here and thus breaking the build).

              hash: 4823b0299002192820d36c90e5d2dfd9ff122ff5
              body: >
                The chrony driftfile is not being updated at shutdown due to an

                incorrect mount service dependency in the systemd chronyd.service

                file. The current dependency on 'var-volatile-lib' does not cover the

                subsequent bind mounting of the '/var/lib/chrony' sub-directory, so

                the chrony directory gets unmounted at shutdown before the drift file

                has been updated.


                This issue is solved by changing the mount service dependency from

                'var-volatile-lib' to 'bind-var-lib-chrony' (which is similar to the

                way bind mount dependencies are already handled for the NetworkManager

                and bluetooth services).

                Newer ones should prefer v1.54, which is the latest rust

                On transitioning from the initramfs to the rootfs, the udev database is

                cleanedup as the rules between initramfs and rootfs might defer.


                However, dm devices are flagged not to be re-processed, so we need to

                set a sticky bit on them so they persist the cleanup.

                This is needed because the rules in the final rootfs might be

                different than the one in the initramfs.


                Devices that need to persist, like dm devices, need to be flagged with

                the `db_persist` option.

                From v2.49, the hostapp-update utility creates the /run directory in the

                root filesystem, however when huping from previous versions /run is not

                there.


                Commit bab3cd7f50022127bfef50fde9cd445b6b55a7b2 switches to use /tmp

                to store the new UUID for the root partition on first boot after

                generating new UUIDs as this is backwards compatible.


                However, this means that the udev database in the initramfs is recreated

                on the final system instead of reused. This becomes a problems for DM

                devices (used in luks based disk encryption), as they are not re-processed

                by udevd.


                This change will use /run if available, so new releases that may implement

                disk encryption work, or /tmp if not so it still remains backwards

                compatible for HUP from older releases.

                Some BSPs name the u-boot such as u-boot-imx_2020 for example.
                Because of that, our existing bbappend called u-boot_%.bbappend
                will not match it and will fail to be applied.
                This PR is a first pass at solving this by moving at least the
                SRC_URI appending part from this bbappend and into the
                resin-u-boot.bbclass instead. Further investigation is needed
                to see if we can remove this bbappend altogether since we may
                have all boards using Poky Warrior or newer, making this
                u-boot bbappend obsolete.

                The CM4 IO-Board was the first device
                which exhibited an issue in which
                the MAC address was set to an
                unprogrammed value AA:AA:AA...:AA.

                We've addressed this in the device repo,
                meanwhile it has been fixed in upstream
                too, so let's check and catch this should
                it happen again.

                do_deploy:append replaces the original file with its signed counterpart,

                the signature just gets ignored for non secure boot setups. The .signed

                symlink was in place for backwards compatibility but nothing is using it

                anymore therefore we can safely remove it.

                The original file should already be deployed, we only need to add

                the signature in do_deploy:append. Re-deploying actually causes

                harm when chaining signatures, replacing a signed file with its

                unsigned counterpart.

                This patch replaces the kernel being shipped with the one that we
                eventually

                sign for EFI - without signing the original file used would be identical

                but after applying signature, the signed version is the one we want to ship.


                It also fixes the file name for the detached signature, which must match

                the name of the associated file.

              hash: 2bb18707557979ed6466f45602de4ecf5b386c57
              body: >
                Add a new timesync-https systemd service to synchronise the system

                time at boot using an HTTPS header. The service uses curl to request

                an HTTPS header from either $API_ENDPOINT/connectivity-check (default)

                or the URL defined by the os.network.connectivity.uri field in

                config.json. The URL used *must* return HTTP code 204 (No Content)

                in response to a request so that we can determine that we have full

                network connectivity and are not operating behind a captive portal.


                The date field returned by a valid header is used to set the current

                system time. The date/time derived from the header is assumed to be a

                reasonable source of 'truth' such that it can be used to adjust the

                system time both backwards and forwards. This will compensate for any

                erroneous timestamps saved via fake-hwclock or any invalid data

                read from an RTC.


                The service will exit when a valid response has been received. Poll

                attempts will be made at an increasing interval starting at 2s and

                doubling up to a maximum of 64s. Polling will continue at the maximum

                interval until a valid response has been received.


                This service will provide initial time synchronisation for devices

                where NTP ports have been blocked. For devices where NTP access is

                available it should ensure that any system 'time jump' is only a few

                seconds when NTP synchronisation is eventually achieved. It also

                allows other services to start with a reasonably accurate time

                without having to wait for the NTP synchronisation process to

                complete.


                Services that are ordered after the new time-sync-https-wait target

                can be sure that full network connectivity has been achieved and that

                time has been synchronised with an accuracy of a few seconds.

                The interface test uses a simple ping to ensure a specific interface

                works. It sends ten packets, and expects ten packets back. However, the

                default interval is one second, which increases the time taken for the

                test while not adding anything of value.


                Reduce the timeout to the minimum non-privileged interval of 2ms.

                The hook tries to read EFI variables from efivarfs but this is not always

                mounted within the container. We have already validated that we are running

                in EFI mode therefore we can just check whether it is already mounted

                and eventually mount with no further checks.


                This also adds graceful handling of nonexistent variables since not all

                UEFI implementations come with secure boot support.

                At this moment GRUB drops to rescue shell if config is invalid

                or if signatures are missing/wrong. This lets the user disable the signature

                checks altogether.


                With this patch GRUB outputs nothing and accepts no user input if signing

                is configured.

                approach and we will look for a clean solution.

                GRUB can not use the TPM easily to unlock the volumes and find the kernel

                on an encrypted partition. Instead, we choose to store a linux kernel

                and use it as 2nd stage bootloader to unlock the partition, load the actual

                kernel and kexec into it. This should eventually be replaced by a proper

                2nd stage bootloader that is being worked on.

                but for the final version they are not and this should pull them

                as dependencies.

                Currently the two classes would keep the original files untouched and
                store

                the signed versions as .signed. This patch reverses the logic - the signed

                files replace the original ones and the unsigned version is stored as .unsigned.

                This is because there is no real use-case for the unsigned files, we always

                want to ship the signed version, even if the particular DT does not require it,

                this causes no harm.

                Previously, the core service exposed a /proxy endpoint that would start

                up a proxy remotely, which would be used by a test in the connectivity

                module. However, the endpoint returned the address for the testbot to be

                used as the proxy in the response, and this required manual

                configuration of the interface. Additionally, it requires the worker

                service to install and provide glider for forward proxying.


                Move the proxy (glider) to a container on the device being tested,

                which simplifies configuration, and reduces the complexity and size of

                the interface of Leviathan.

                Add a test to wait for the chronyd service to become active before

                starting the time sync tests.


                The current chronyd tests assume that the chronyd service is

                instantly available at boot time. With the addition of the new

                HTTPS time synchronisation service the starting of chronyd can be

                delayed by a few seconds so we need to ensure that the service

                is actually running before proceeding.

                        previously switch would treat S_IFIFO and S_IFSOCK as the same, passing

                        both of the to mkfifo, which lead to EINVAL errors when trying to create

                        the socket, we instead handle socket separately.


                        Also adds cases for this to the unit and integration tests of the

                        migrator.

                The boot partition needs to be generated before creating the balenaos-img

                but is not part of the root filesystem generation.


                The decoupling allows to build just the docker rootfs image without

                having to build the balenaos-img target.

                When the limit is reached, u-boot will proceed to try

                The Rock Pi 4B uses a file named hw_intf.conf for

                Just noting that the syntax is also slightly different
                from the config.txt file on RaspberryPi.

                Let's blacklist this file to avoid overriding
                it during an OS update.

              body: >
                When user namespacing was enabled in the kernel by default, a separate

                commit [0] was introduced to disable the feature at runtime, to allow

                users/administrators to explicitly choose to enable it, avoiding

                potential security implications.


                However, some applications such as Chromium's sandbox, require either

                SUID or user namespacing to work. Disabling this feature on boards

                that previously enabled it necessitates container modifications and

                potentially breaks previously working applications.


                Create a distro feature to disable user namespacing by default in

                meta-balena, while allowing device types to keep it enabled to maintain

                compatibility with their original behavior.

                from here. Instead, the logo will be used from the hw contracts.

                The balena-build.sh script accepts a token in the command line. This

                commit modifies the prepare-and-start.sh script to use it if

                available, and also modifies it to take into account the balena

                environment too.

                When fetching images for blocks, use a given release revision.


                Also, add token autentication to the API calls that miss it so that they work

                with private device types.


                Finally, fix indentation.

                When using the now deprecated release_version field, the API would

                reject deployments for an existing release.


                On the new versioning model, deployments increment a revision field so

                there is no need to check for uniqueness.

                BalenaCloud has now a release versioning feature that deprecates the

                use of release_version.


                Introduce a new balena_lib_release() function that utilises a balena

                contract and the CLI to set the release version.

        fatwrite command can fail under
        specific circumstances, like for
        instance when there were around
        20 files in the filesystem. This
        was caused by an incorrect cast.

        We backport a patch from upstream
        to avoid potential failure to boot
        after HUP, when bootcount is saved
        to the FAT partition.

        Failure log:

                The previous commit moved the preloaded image out of yocto cache, which

                made it unreachable from the balena-generate-ami-env container.


                This patch makes mktemp create the file back within yocto cache to ensure

                this is shared yet still each concurrent process can safely have its own copy.

                Since the file name is hardcoded at this moment, this fails when two

                builds are running in parallel (e.g. dev and prod variants during deploy)

                because they try to preload the same file at pretty much the same moment.

                Having a separate copy for each outside of yocto cache should fix the issue.

                At runtime we can now enable development features that were previously

                configured using the development-image feature. That feature also

                configured U-Boot for OS development.


                Now we have two distinct functionalities:


                * A runtime development configuration variable that configures the

                device to facilitate application development

                * A build time osdev-image feature that configures the OS for BSP and OS

                development


                This allows us to merge the current production/development images into

                a single image.

                The images now can be configured for application development mode at
                runtime.

                This commit introduces a built time option to configure them for BSP or

                other OS development like board bringup.

                        This brings all migration logic into a single call into the

                        storagemigration package, which should make future maintenance easier

                        and fixes the cleanup logic bug, where the old aufs root would never be

                        cleaned up.

                        In these cases we want to avoid restarting the same services

                        manually from the supervisor.

                        PR #1749 introduced a bug when pushing local target state. An update to

                        the [image name normalization](https://github.com/balena-os/balena-supervisor/blob/f1bd4b8d9bcef29e326cbf97eaddd837c2704d19/src/lib/docker-utils.ts#L81)

                        failed to consider the local image name format. This results in mangling

                        of image names in the database, i.e. the image `ubuntu:latest` is stored

                        as `/ubuntu:latest`. This causes an exception to be returned by the

                        dockerode `getImage('/ubuntu:latest').inspect()` call.


                        This sends the supervisor into a crash loop and is shown on the supervisor

                        journal logs as


                        ```

                        getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND images
                            at GetAddrInfoReqWrap.onlookup [as oncomplete] (dns.js:64:26)
                        ```


                        Unfortunately if this happens on a user device, since the mangled image

                        name is already on the database, the easiest way to fix is to remove the

                        supervisor database and let the supervisor recreate it. Deleting the

                        database should be side effect free.

                        dependent ids optional and rely on using general UUIDs and user known identifiers

                        for comparison. This PR moves forward in that direction by removing some of those

                        comparisons for v2 target state.


                        - imageId to be replaced with imageName

                        - releaseId to be replaced by commit (future release_uuid)


                        This is a backwards compatible change, meaning it doesn't completely get rid of

                        these identifiers (which are still being used by supervisor API and for state

                        patch), but will not depend on those identifiers for calculating steps to target state.

                      body: >
                        The image manager module now uses tags instead of docker IDs as the main

                        way to identify docker images on the engine. That is, if the target

                        state image has a name `imageName:tag@digest`, the supervisor will always use

                        the given `imageName` and `tag` (which may be empty) to tag the image on

                        the engine after fetching. This PR also adds checkups to ensure

                        consistency is maintained between the database and the engine.


                        Using tags allows to simplify query and removal operations, since now

                        removing the image now means removing tags matching the image name.


                        Before this change the supervisor relied only on information in the

                        supervisor database, and used that to remove images by docker ID. However, the docker

                        id is not a reliable identifier, since images retain the same id between

                        releases or between services in the same release.

                        The previous module was using `rewire` to get the knex instance from the

                        db module but that was leading to issues when running tests using `test:fast`.

                        This provides a fix for the test module that just removes the destroy

                        call entirely (it turns out it is not necessary).

                need to include this file in the package.


                This is not a problem when using kernel-source as a modules_prepare is

                always required.

                This allows to re-use this functionality. Note that the `KERNEL_VERSION`

                variable is only available after the kernel has been built as it relies

                on get_kernelversion_headers() poky function and utsrelease.h being

                generated. This function parses the Makefile so only needs the source.

                Currently 'chronyc onoffline' is run for 'up/down' events on any

                network interface. It makes more sense to run it for

                'connectivity-change' events as we are really interested in whether

                the internet is there or not rather than whether an interface is

                up or down.

              hash: 31c3ae8ad5c7ad45e450349b6972524da120e96c
              body: >
                Most major distributions now ship kernels with user namespacing enabled

                in the kernel config. Some distributions, such as Arch and Ubuntu,

                default to the upstream behavior of allowing unprivileged user

                namespacing, regardless of potential attack surfaces exposed in the

                kernel.


                Other distributions, such as Debian, are slightly more conservative,

                disabling the feature at runtime behind a sysctl tunable. Debian

                maintains its own patch to add the kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone

                tunable.


                The Debian patch was rejected by upstream over fears of application

                developers not using this feature due to it being generally unavailable

                in systems, as well as fears of bugs going undiscovered.


                RHEL uses a newer tunable introduced upstream to set the max number of

                user namespaces to zero, which accomplishes the same thing, but without

                an out of tree patch.


                Disable user namespacing at runtime using the same method as RHEL, in

                the same manner as the hardened kernels and distributions have chosen.

                There is at least a case in a board where the puts function in u-boot's

                common/console.c is #ifdef'ed and defined twice. Let's accomodate for

                such cases by correctly looping through more than one function

                definition if present.

                introduced when images including 8227a61f6bef6d93cc6a5acd0ef93a2012079964

                made it to production.

                We can now use a runtime drop-in unit placed under /run/systemd/ to

                configure the balena-host service, which doesn't require us to remount

                the rootfs.

                is not possible. Symlinking /dev/null will break the services as well.

                Having the lines limited to 500 meant we were missing

                We also don't need to list boots and can use the 'all'
                arguement to see all logs.
