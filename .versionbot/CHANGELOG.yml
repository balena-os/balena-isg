                After switching to LUKS2, the header size increased from 2MB to
                16MB.

                While HUP of older systems works, it is impossible to provision

                new encrypted systems.


                This patch fixes the header size in flasher.

                      hash: 71d24d6e3366b28e1466e99322d58420b5ebbb67
                      body: >
                        The previous implementation in #2170 of parsing the
                        container status was too general,

                        because it relied on the mistaken assumption that a container would have a status of

                        `Stopped` if it was manually stopped. This turned out to be untrue, as manually stopped

                        containers were also getting restarted by the Supervisor due to their inspect status of

                        `exited`. With this, parsing the exit message became unavoidable as there are no other

                        clear ways to discern a container that has been manually stopped and shouldn't be started

                        from a container experiencing the Engine-host race condition issue (again, see #2170).


                        Since we're just parsing the exit error message, we don't need to worry about different behaviors

                        amongst restart policies, as any container with the error message on exit should be started.

                        Previously, `concatReadSeekCloser.Read()` would
                        incorrectly return

                        an `io.ErrUnexpectedEOF` if the last read from the second concatenated

                        `Reader` didn't completely fill the passed buffer.


                        For instance:


                        ```
                              First Reader    Second Reader
                            |aaaaaaaaaaaaa|bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb|      <--- concatReadSeekCloser
                            |--- previously read ---|--- buffer ---| <--- last read
                                                              |xxxx| <--- "excess" buffer
                        ```


                        In this example, we have a `concatReadSeekCloser` that concatenates two

                        `Reader`s (`aaa...` and `bbb...`). The last `Read()` used a buffer

                        larger than the yet-to-be-read portion of the `bbb...`. So, it would

                        incorrectly return an `io.ErrUnexpectedEOF`.


                        This commit makes sure that last `Read()` returns all the remaining data

                        without an error. It also adds various test cases for

                        `concatReadSeekCloser.Read()`, many of which would fail before this

                        correction.


                        Interestingly, this bug was silently affecting us. Not in a fatal way,

                        but causing deltas to be larger than necessary. Indeed, running

                        `TestDeltaSize` after this commit shows that some test cases are

                        producing deltas smaller than what we expected before. For posterity,

                        see all the details below.


                        We use `concatReadSeekCloser`s to concatenate all layers of the basis

                        image when creating the "signature" of the basis image. In this process,

                        the `concatReadSeekCloser`s are wrapped around by a buffered reader with

                        a buffer of 65kB.


                        If, in any read, part of this 65kB buffer was beyond the second

                        concatenated reader, it would result in an `io.ErrUnexpectedEOF`. This

                        would not cause the whole process to fail, but would prematurely end the

                        signature generation: some of the final blocks in the basis image would

                        not be added to the signature. Therefore, if those blocks appeared in

                        the target image, they'd result in (larger) LITERAL, instead of

                        (smaller) COPY operations.


                        For illustration, here's the delta generated for the `delta-006-008`

                        test case. First before this commit:

                        That 21kB LITERAL is the difference in size we saw in the test results.

                        This is necessary since the builder no longer passes the
                        platform flag

                        to the build. This would lead to dockerfiles that are mixing multi and single

                        arch stages to pull the wrong architecture images, particularly when

                        trying to build images in emulated builds (e.g. armv7hf built on aarch64).


                        Moving the full build to multi-arch solves this as the docker engine is

                        capable of chosing the right architecture from the manifest.

                This should be the default but with no explicit argument we
                still

                end up with LUKS1 partitions. This patch adds the parameter to enforce

                LUKS2 formatting and adds conversion to LUKS2 to the cryptsetup

                initrd script.

                This helper command saves and compares crc32 sum for a memory
                area where the kernel image or the device-tree is loaded.

                Can be used after loading the kernel and the dtb, and also prior
                to calling booti.

                    - subject: Handle Engine-host race condition for "always" and "unless-stopped"
                        restart policy
                      hash: 7f3214195838a8bf3242ef7540b4487338687e4c
                      body: >
                        There exists a race condition between Engine and a host
                        resource that may not

                        be immediately created. In this race condition, if a container's compose config

                        depends on the existence of that host resource, such as a network interface, and the

                        Engine tries to create & start the container before the host resource is created, the

                        Engine will not reattempt to start the container, regardless of the restart policy.

                        This is undesireable behavior but seems to be the behavior as implemented by Docker.


                        To rectify this, the Supervisor state funnel noops for a grace period of 1 minute

                        after starting a container to see that the container's status has become 'running`.

                        If the container exits because of the race condition, the status becomes 'exited' and the

                        Supervisor will attempt to generate another start step. This noop-wait-start step loop

                        will repeat until the container is able to start.


                        If the container is never able to start, there was a problem in the host in the creation of the

                        host resource, and that should be fixed at the host level.


                        This commit does not handle the case of services with restart policies "no" or "on-failure"

                        which encounter this host race, as metadata from container inspects needs to be introduced

                        during step calculation in order to figure out whether services with those restart policies

                        need to be started. This will be fixed in a future PR.

      hash: 84928f67e417f9f416ab6195f7464ab5736eaa4c
      body: >
        Backporting to ESR branches hits a flowzone error as both pull_request

        and pull_request_target run and this only works for master.


        Removing the pull_request_target run for ESR branches fixes this, but

        also removes the possibility of external pull requests into ESR branches,

        which we don't actually need.

                When running in the initramfs, the resin-device-progress package
                is not

                installed as we cannot guarantee that the initramfs would be able to

                bring up all types of network interfaces.


                This commit adds a check for the script to exists instead of getting a

                `command not found` when an API endpoint is defined.

                to fail builds because of temporary network or API access problems.


                Printing a warning instead should be enough for developers to detect

                breaking changes.

                When programming keys for secure boot, some devices do not clear

                the setup mode flag after a new PK is installed. In this case

                flasher will reboot in order to ensure the keys are actually saved

                and the device comes back with secure boot enabled. Since we changed

                flasher to be unsigned by default, this reboot causes a security

                violation.


                With this patch flasher will add a new boot entry before issuing

                the reboot so that signed flasher comes up and the installation process

                can continue.

                Currently the db.auth file is signed as "append" in order to
                make HUP work.

                Most UEFI firmwares will accept such file even for "replace", which we do

                during the initial provisioning, however we have seen devices that will

                only allow appending, which makes flasher fail.


                With this patch flasher will use the esl file for initial programming

                of the db variable.


                PK and KEK are unaffected.

                        Previously, we'd time-out a pull operation after
                        unsuccessfully retrying

                        for about 17 minutes (for details see commit

                        582487f832c59c2f734a780ab0492833f29002c9). This worked fine in most

                        situations, but we have seen at least one case of a particularly

                        unreliable network connection that would not be able to finish a large

                        pull when operating under this policy.


                        This commit:


                        * Completely removes timeouts from image pulls. We'll keep retrying
                          forever, or until users cancel the pull. (From the perspective of the
                          REST API, "canceling" mean closing the HTTP connection. This is what
                          happens when a user Ctrl+C during a pull in the CLI, or, say, we kill
                          a curl process that was using the REST API to pull image.)
                        * Still uses exponential back-off, but we now limit the interval between
                          retries to 5 minutes. The rationale is that some very unreliable
                          networks may be up only for relatively small time windows. Therefore,
                          using intervals that are too long would increase the risk of missing
                          these windows.
                        * Tries to avoid flooding the log stream with messages about retries.
                          We'll log every retry attempt up to the 10th. After that, we'll log
                          retries only once about every 2h. This retry count is reset every time
                          we successfully download any amount of data.

                        the flasher image to force an installer migration.


                        With the current QEMU setting, `installerForceMigration` alone is not

                        enough and the QEMU_INTERNAL_STORAGE also needs to be set to false in

                        the worker's environment so only a single external disk is attached to

                        the emulator.

                        After a recent change enforcing all the partitions to be
                        on the same

                        block device, encrypted partitions are no longer being detected

                        correctly. This is because the assumption that the parent block device

                        is a substring of the actually mounted block device does not work

                        for LUKS devices - the mount will either be /dev/mapper/luks-XXX

                        or /dev/dm-X while the parent device is still e.g. /dev/sda.


                        The usual balenaOS boot partition is also split in two - boot and efi.

                        The boot partition (mounted under /mnt/boot) is encrypted and the efi

                        partition (mounted under /mnt/efi) is not.


                        This patch generalizes the detection of the parent device so that

                        it works with both encrypted and unencrypted partitions.

                        The docker compose V2 spec no longer accepts
                        `network_mode: bridge`,

                        which means we can no longer override the network configuration of

                        the `balena-supervisor` service for tests.


                        For this reason we now create a separate service to run the built

                        supervisor `balena-supervisor-sut` and run API tests against this

                        service instead of the default `balena-supervisor`.

                At this moment if the cryptsetup initrd script executes before
                the root

                device comes up (e.g. when booting off a USB disk), it assumes

                that encryption is not in place because it was not able to find

                the EFI partition.


                This patch adds a wait4file loop to the script that waits

                for the /dev/disk/by-state directory. This is not tied to any particular

                partition or device but since the directory does not exist by default

                and is only created by a custom balenaOS udev rule, its existence

                implies that the rule fired and a device with balenaOS partitions

                is present in the system.

                        A bug in service comparison would make it that a device

                        a service from a new release with network changes would never stop the

                        running service so remaining services would forever get stuck in

                        `Downloaded` state.


                        This fixes the comparison so the service will get killed in this case,

                        stuck with some

                        services in the `Downloaded` state, because the state engine does not

                        detect that the running services should be killed on a network change

                        even if they belong to a new release. This is a bug, which can be

                        replicated by the tests in this commit

                        Previous behavior would make it that an `updateMetadata`
                        step would take

                        precedence over a `kill` step when network changes are present. This

                        would lead to an inconsistent state if an update included a

                        network and a container change.

                        allows the device to eventually get to the desired target configuration.

                        using dind.

                        those credentials are meant for balena registry and will otherwise fail.

                A safe copy would only work for files that are read by fatrw
                also and that is

                not the case for boot files. Still, some file like `config.json` would

                benefit from a safe copy so we still try that first.


                Fixes #2998

                If a safe copy is preferred but non-critical, the unsafe fatrw
                command

                can be used and if fatrw does not have enough resources to make a safe

                copy it will fallback to a standard cp.


                This is useful when performing hostOS updates for example where a safe

                copy would only work for files that are read by fatrw also and that is

                not the case for boot files for example.

                        The actions now work by passing an intermediate state to
                        the state

                        engine.


                        - doPurge first removes the user app from the target state and passes
                          that to the state engine for purging. Since intermediate state doesn't
                          remove images, this will have the effect of basically re-installing
                          the app.

                        - doRestart modifies the target state by first removing only the
                          services from the current state but keeping volumes and networks. This
                          has the same effect as before where services were stopped one by one

                        There were multiple places in the state engine that
                        skipped some

                        operations while in local mode. In reality, all it's needed while in

                        local mode is to skip image and volume deletion.


                        This commit simplifies application-manager and compose app to be more

                        local mode agnostic and instead making the image deletion and volume

                        deletion configurable via function arguments.


                        This also has the benefit to make the treatment of local mode

                        applications more similar to cloud mode applications, allowing for

                        API endpoints to function the same way both modes.

                When parsing additional variables to be passed to the bitbake
                build,

                keys and values are split using equals as a delimiter. However, the

                splitting process does not split only on the first occurrence, which

                results in removing equals signs from the value as well. This is

                problematic with base64 encoded strings, which are padded with equals

                signs.


                Split only on the first occurrence, leaving the value intact.

                After moving to hashes for authenticating the allowed OS list,
                we need

                to update the db variable on each HUP to make sure the new OS

                will be bootable. After confirming that the update went through,

                we need to update the dbx variable to make sure the old OS is

                no longer bootable.

              hash: c205b247c14cbdd132cb1bb335da2d17fa40caf5
              body: >
                This patch changes the validation of bootable images from
                certificate

                signatures to a list of allowed hashes of binaries. This only applies

                on db level, PK and KEK are still certificates.


                The motivation is that certificates expire and we need to be sure

                that even devices that have been lying on a shelf for several years

                or whose CMOS battery has died and reset date to 1970-01-01 are still

                bootable. Using hashes is more aligned with this use-case and also

                more similar to the approach that embedded SoCs use.

              hash: 1eb49acca051d7c34fa0e48bd673fc764320b2e9
              body: >
                Shipping a single image with signature checks enabled will
                enforce

                the signatures on non-secure-boot systems as well. GRUB does not have

                a simple method to check whether secure boot is enabled that could

                be embedded with the default built-in config.


                With this patch we build two separate images - one enforcing

                the signatures and the other one not, keeping the original behavior.

                HUP and flasher both can detect if secure boot is enabled so they

                put the correct image in place when installing/updating GRUB.

                        Node 15 [changed the way it treats unhandled promise
                        rejections](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/doc/changelogs/CHANGELOG_V15.md#throw-on-unhandled-rejections---33021)
                        from a warning to a throw.

                        For this reason errors like a corrupt migration directory, that happens when trying to

                        roll back to a previous supervisor version were no longer showing a

                        message but dumping the full minimized code into the journal logs.


                        This PR adds a catchall on app.ts to log the exception and throw an exit

                        code of 1.

                        Restart-service checks that both services have restarted in its test assertion, which is

                        incorrect as restart-service should only restart one service.

                      hash: 49ee1042a87ce0b101054e32b84afaa324a371de
                      body: >
                        As the Supervisor is a privileged container, it has
                        access to host /dev, and therefore has access

                        to boot, data, and state balenaOS partitions. This commit sets up the framework for the following:


                        - Finds the /dev partition that corresponds to each partition based on partition label

                        - Mounts the partitions into set mountpoints in the device

                        - Removes reliance on env vars and mountpoints provided by host's start-balena-supervisor script

                        - Simplifies host path querying by centralizing these queries through methods in lib/host-utils.ts


                        This particular changes env vars for and mounts the boot partition.


                        Since the Supervisor would no longer rely on container `run` arguments provided by a host script,

                        this change moves Supervisor closer to being able to start itself (Supervisor-as-an-app).

                        Notable improvements these new versions bring:


                        * Optimized code path for generating deltas with blocks that are
                          power-of-two-sized.
                        * Avoid allocating unbounded amounts of memory when the target differs
                          completely from the source.
                        * Several bugfixes in edge cases that shall not affect balenaEngine.

                Setting `LimitCORE=0` will avoid the creation of core dump files
                on

                containers. This will avoid cases in which a crashlooping user app ends

                up filling up the entire storage with dump files.


                Users can re-enable core dumps in their services by manually setting the

                `ulimits.core`. For example:

                        The original delta code on the `xfer` package used to
                        set `d.err` when

                        an unexpected EOF was found in the delta tar stream. Turns out `d.err`

                        would end up being overwritten before it was read, so that initial

                        assignment was effectively a no-op.


                        This commit simplifies the code a little bit by removing this bogus

                        assignment and also improves the error reporting a notch by adding more

                        context to the error messages.

                        was a good deal of duplication.


                        This piece of code is tricky to factor out into a separate function.

                        Basically we had two options:


                        1. Create a completely reusable, DRY function that encapsulates all the
                           duplicate code. Sounds nice until you noticed that would be a
                           horrendous function with 5 return values and overly obscure
                           semantics.
                        2. We create a small set of functions with clearer interfaces and
                           semantics, but which will still lead to some code duplication between
                           the `pull` and `load` implementations.

                        I opted for the second alternative because the resulting code is much

                        easier to understand and maintain. Also, the remaining duplication is

                        mostly dumb, integration and error handling code that almost writes

                        itself as we call the new reusable functions -- so, this is sort of a

                        benign duplication.

                        This is necessary since the builder no longer passes the
                        platform flag

                        to the build. This would lead to dockerfiles that are mixing multi and single

                        arch stages to pull the wrong architecture images, particularly when

                        trying to build images in emulated builds (e.g. armv7hf built on aarch64).


                        Moving the full build to multi-arch solves this as the docker engine is

                        capable of chosing the right architecture from the manifest.

                        There were various usages of Bash-specific features. As
                        a result, the

                        script would work correctly only on OSes that have `sh` as an alias to

                        `bash`. It would fail on Ubuntu, for example.

                        A couple of changes here:


                        * Check for sudo necessity and availability before doing any real work.
                          Better to warn and exit quick and early!
                        * Remove the support for using `su`. It was broken for two reasons.
                          First, unlike `sudo`, `su -c` expects the command as a single
                          argument. Second, `su`, unlike `sudo`, reads the password from stdin
                          which in this case "contains" the tarball being downloaded. The second
                          point is particularly tricky to solve without saving the tarball to
                          storage (and we want to avoid extra storage space and wear). And,
                          anyway, users that can `su -c` can also `su` manually before
                          installing.

                          warn and exit quick and early!
                        * Fix the actual check. We previously used `[ $abort ] && exit 1` which
                          caused the script to always exit (`abort` is never empty).

                        Added an `Asserting` suffix to all functions that

                        `assert.*()`. This makes clearer what is really going on at the point of

                        call, without needing to look under the hood.

                The patch applied to systemd addressed this upstream moby issue:

                https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/27202


                This was fixed in containerd 1.0.2:

                https://github.com/containerd/console/pull/10/commits/c358734ec94e72903243bd1c9034874a1de09424


                This fix is present in balena engine since v17.13.5, which has been in

                use since commit 53ce147. Drop this patch from meta-balena-dunfell and

                later.

                        Some incoming tests require QEMU to exit, simulating a
                        device powering

                        off, before starting QEMU again. This is used to "reflash" a virtualized

                        device before continuing with testing, for instance after tampering with

                        boot files on a secure boot enabled device to verify secure boot checks.


                        However, swtpm will exit when QEMU disconnects. The `--exit-code-from`

                        compose argument implies `--abort-on-container-exit`, so this results

                        in the test run aborting prematurely.


                        Adapt the entrypoint and command of the swtpm container to always

                        restart the program without exiting the container.

                The QEMU leviathan-worker now simulates flashing from an
                external

                device, which tests both flasher images, as well as

                secure-boot/full-disk encryption setup.


                Disable the ad-hoc unwrapping in the OS suite setup.

                Disable ad-hoc unwrapping in the HUP test suite in favor of
                utilizing

                the QEMU worker's new ability to bind a disk image to an emulated

                external USB mass storage device. This runs the flasher in QEMU, and

                installs to emulated internal storage.

                It should be safe to assume that boards now use newer u-boot
                versions

                that all have Kconfig support so we default to that. This allows for

                device repos not to specify it and use Kconfig support or if for some

                reason there are boards with old u-boot versions they can overwrite the

                UBOOT_KCONFIG_SUPPORT variable to 0.

                Because we use this patch with various u-boot versions it often
                happens that this patch

                does not apply so we then need to rework it in the device integration layer. Instead it

                would be better to have some code at configure time parsing the same file and inserting

                the balena env dynamically, so regardless of u-boot versions we use.

                        Preloaded devices can require that the device is pinned
                        to the preloaded

                        release on provisioning. However if the provisioned release gets

                        released in the future, that would lead to the device remaining in "VPN

                        only" state forever as the provisioning process could not finish due to

                        pinning failure.


                        This commit changes the behavior so if the release does not exist, the

                        pinning step is skipped and the device follows the fleet pinning state.

                        This is necessary since the builder no longer passes the
                        platform flag

                        to the build. This would lead to dockerfiles that are mixing multi and single

                        arch stages to pull the wrong architecture images, particularly when

                        trying to build images in emulated builds (e.g. armv7hf built on aarch64).


                        Moving the full build to single-arch solves this as the docker engine is

                        capable of chosing the right architecture from the manifest. Once some

                        of the builder issues are fixed, we should move to #2141

                        The issue with the original Supervisor implementation of
                        the firewall is that

                        on Supervisor start, the Supervisor flushes the INPUT chain of the filter table.

                        This doesn't play well with services that add to the INPUT chain on startup that

                        may start up before the Supervisor, such as certain NetworkManager connection

                        profiles. This change only replaces the BALENA-FIREWALL rule in the INPUT chain,

                        preserving the other rules as well as their order.

                In the Internet connection sharing test one of the checks may
                run

                into a racing problem. The following command is holding the iptables

                lock for 3 seconds while NetworkManager activates a connection with

                sharing enabled:


                `flock /run/xtables.lock sleep 3 & nmcli c up dummy & wait`


                NetworkManager waits for 2 seconds for the lock to be released and

                those three seconds should be enough for one of the iptables rules

                to fail. However there is no guarantee that NetworkManager will start

                adding the iptables rules that quickly - it may start adding those

                after one out of those three seconds already passed, which will

                lead to all iptables rules to be set at the end.


                This check is non-essential for the test itself, so it is removed with

                this commit.

                At this moment, when module signing is enabled, the peak module
                is signed

                but do_install ignores the signed variant and installs the original

                unsigned file. With this patch do_install installs the signed file

                if available.

                Previously, we bailed out of the installer when the system was
                in user

                mode (keys enrolled) but the user had not opted in to secure boot, as it

                was ambiguous whether the user actually wanted SB/FDE.


                However, some systems come with vendor keys pre-enrolled, and a user may

                simply turn off secure boot in the firmware setup menu without erasing

                the keys. This would result in the installer bailing out even though

                secure boot is disabled in the firmware menu.


                Check that secure boot is enabled in addition to having keys enrolled

                before bailing out.

                Test for the NetworkManager patch done in

                https://github.com/balena-os/meta-balena/pull/2963


                A racing condition between balenaEngine and NetworkManager led to some Internet

                connection sharing iptables rules not being applied when NM connection profile

                with Internet sharing was activated at boot.


                This test checks whether all necessary iptables rules are added by artificially

                blocking iptables for 1 second and then for 3 seconds while a connection

                profile with Internet sharing is activated.

                We have added DER certificates because it is the only format

                that QEMU/TianoCore accepts in UEFI setup. Since we made setup mode

                work properly, there is no need to program the QEMU keys manually

                and therefore there is no reason to pollute the boot partition with

                the DER files. If indeed necessary, they can always be extracted

                from the ESL, which is still shipped. Shipping the DER files is also

                not possible when db uses hashes instead of certificates, which we

                want to move towards.

                Previously, it was being referred to only as "balena". Being
                explicit

                that this is about balenaEngine makes it simpler to grep for

                Engine-related portions of balenaOS. Might also help a tad bit when

                looking at logs.

                When migrating, we can't assume a device can be remotely powered

                finish the flashing with a reboot instead of a shutdown.


                This is possible as the initramfs does not currently have a shutdown

                command and avoids the complexity of having to detect whether we are

                running from initramfs or not.

                When `recovery` is passed in the kernel command line, the
                initramfs will

                not boot into the OS but launch adbd.


                A connection can then be established via the network (if a DHCP address

                is provided) or using a USB gadget connection.


                For a network connection, the client needs to install `adb` and run:

                ```

                adb connect $IPADDR:5555

                adb shell

                ```


                Other adb commands, like pull/push of files are also available.

                `balena-config-vars` gets used in the initramfs but `fatrw` is not

                so listing them here is redundant and wrong as it increases the size of

                balenaOS uboot exports specific environment variables

                in resinOS_uEnv.txt and does not have any use-cases of

                saving the entire uboot environment in any device specific

                partitions. This because it relies on the default environment being

                stored in the u-boot binary.


                Let's disable the saveenv command and avoid potential incorrect

                usage which may overwrite the partition table, resin-boot filesystem

                or other areas of the eMMC that may be pre-configured by the BSP.

                becase the devices need to be put in USB MASS STORAGE
                mode prior to flashing of the eMMC, and the Radxa
                flashing tools are actually included in the contract
                partials.

                - The Jetson TX2 NX has an eMMC and no SD-CARD slot

                - The JN30B Nano uses the eMMC module and not the SD-CARD one

                - The Radxa CM3 on RPI CM4 IOBoard as well as the Radxa zero use
                  rockchip software tools in order to put the eMMC in mass-storage mode
                - The CM4 module comes in two flavors: one with eMMC and the Lite version
                  which uses the carrier board sd-card slot to load the image. Both use the
                  same balenaOS image.
                  I switched the storage to internal for this DT because it *may* have
                  one, but this solely depends on the actual module.
                  Another consideration is that this DT can also boot from a USB stick
                  or a NVME drive connected to the mPCIE port.

                Block device nodes are sometimes created without attached media.
                These

                devices can neither be read from, nor written to. In this case, the

                flasher will attempt to install to the invalid disk and fail.  Detect

                this case and skip the disk to allow flashing to continue.

                        exceptions, and makes debugging and log messages worse.


                        When we don't have a valid way to handle an exception, just throw it.

                        The traceback is more useful than the handler.

                The engine is currently versioned in such a way that upstream
                semver tags are added to branches before merging to master.

                We don't want to try and pin to those commits so only
                consider automated GitHub Releases.

                        names for some

                        reason. While we don't know the cause the networks get duplicates, this

                        can be disruptive for updates as trying to create a container referencing a duplicate

                        network results in a 400 error from the engine.


                        This commit finds and removes duplicate networks via the state engine,

                        this means that even if somehow a container could be referencing a

                        network that has been duplicated later somehow, this will remove the

                        container first.


                        While thies doesn't solve the problem of duplicate networks being

                        created in the first place, it will fix the state of the system to

                        correct the inconsistency.

                      hash: 180c4ff31ad719fb2b00217548514d42a4b5c4cf
                      body: >
                        We have seen a few times devices with duplicated network
                        names for some

                        reason. While we don't know the cause the networks get duplicates,

                        this is disruptive of updates, as the supervisor usually queries

                        resource by name, resulting in a 400 error from the engine because of

                        the ambiguity.


                        This replaces those queries by name to queries by id. This includes

                        network removal. If a `removeNetwork` step is generated, the supervisor

                        opts to remove all instances of the network with the same name as it

                        cannot easily resolve the ambiguity.


                        This doesn't solve the problem of ambiguous networks, because even if

                        networks are referenced by id when creating a container, the engine will

                        throw an error (see https://github.com/balena-os/balena-supervisor/issues/590#issuecomment-1423557871)

                The os-helpers scripts are meant to be sourced by other scripts,
                not

                executed. When sourced, the shebang should be ignored.


                However, we have seen instances where a bash script sourcing a sh

                os-helper scripts triggers POSIX behaviour, specifically glob parsing

                failures.

              hash: 73ca2d64f9bc22764694f774898db02a6c9e9825
              body: >
                When a user runs the flasher with secure boot enabled in
                `config.json`,

                the public keys used to validate the bootloader are enrolled. If any

                other bootloader signature fails to validate against this public key, it

                won't be executed.


                If the user attempts to run the balenaOS flasher on that system again

                without first enabling the secure boot option, the flasher won't enroll

                keys, but the installed system will be signed. This will result in a

                secure boot enabled system without full-disk encryption.


                Bail out in this case so the user must choose to explicitly opt-in to

                secure boot for the new installation, and full-disk encryption along

                with it. Otherwise, the user must reset the enrolled keys to install

                without secure boot.

                Extended globbing is not enabled by default, which makes the
                substring

                match for trimming leading zeroes not work. This causes SETUPMODEVAR to

                evaluate to "01", which fails comparison with the string "1", skipping

                key enrollment when secure boot is enabled. Compare using an integer

                expression instead.

                When refactoring secure boot setup, a logic mistake in the
                purpose and

                use of SECUREBOOT_VAR meant that devices booting the flasher with keys already

                enrolled would bail out with an incorrect message about secure boot not

                being supported in firmware.


                This variable is `00` on systems with secure boot support in firmware,

                but not enabled and enforced, `01` on systems where secure boot is

                enforced, and empty when secure boot is unsupported.


                Change this conditional to bail out only when the variable is empty,

                indicating that secure boot is unsupported.

                        QEMU is capable of using an emulated software TPM
                        exposed via socket. A

                        TPM is necessary for full disk encryption (FDE), so add a service to

                        provide this to the QEMU worker.

                get_dev_path_from_label() calls lsblk to get the name and label
                of a

                disk, then filters the list using the label and returns a /dev path.


                The name returned when using a luks encrypted partition is the

                /dev/mapper name, rather than the kernel's device mapper name under

                /dev/dm-*. When assembling a path under /dev using the luks name, the

                path is invalid, and the by-state links aren't created.


                This leads to the rootfs hook failing to find and mount the resin-rootA

                partition.


                Change the attribute retrieved using lsblk to kname to fix this.

                This allows for the testbot to set resin_flasher_skip=0

                bypass the boot switch detection mechanisms used for
                specific private device types.

                The boot pins would otherwise prevent the flasher
                from running if they were set to the eMMC position.

                The flasher extra_uEnv.txt file overrides any resin_flasher_skip
                value previously configured by the device integration layer.

              body: >
                In v2.108.0 we did a major NetworkManager upgrade as we started
                using

                meson as a build system. The connectivity check feature was left

                disabled, which is a regression and it produces fake results.


                This commit enables it back.


                Fixes #2964.

              body: >
                iptables takes a file lock at /run/xtables.lock. By default, if

                the file is locked, iptables will fail with error. When that happens,

                the iptables rules won't be configured, and the shared mode

                (for which we use iptables) will not be setup properly.


                Instead, pass "--wait 2", to block.


                The included patch has to be removed once we upgrade to next

                NetworkManager version as it is already included upstream.

                The previous method of disabling NTP by stopping the nameserver

                (dnsmasq) relied on the dnsmasq unit not being reactivated before the

                test completed.


                Instead, disable NTP by blocking ntp.org in the local dnsmasq instance

                using a dbus method call. NTP is re-enabled as before, by restarting

                dnsmasq.

              hash: 345d1440d34fe042f03884c4ae32f0ba7e7768e8
              body: >
                In rare cases (believed to be caused by a non-atomic file
                creation and

                writing operation in containerd), we end up with an empty file at

                `/mnt/data/docker/containerd/daemon/io.containerd.grpc.v1.introspection/uuid`.

                This causes `ctr version` (and hence the health check) to fail. See

                https://github.com/balena-os/balena-engine/issues/322


                This commit addresses this issue in two ways:


                1. Before running `ctr version`, we check if the uuid file exists and is
                   empty. If so, we remove it. (The subsequent execution of `ctr
                   version` by the healthcheck will create the file again.)
                2. After running `ctr version`, we check if the uuid file was really
                   created and is not empty.

                In both cases, when an empty uuid file is detected, we log the event to

                help us confirm our hypothesis about the root cause.

              body: >
                Main NetworkManager recipe was migrated to match latest one from

                meta-openembedded, so that all improvements are merged now.


                Excluded from it are `iwd` and `dhcpcd` daemon configurations that are

                not used by us.


                Default NM firewall in meta-openembedded is `nftables` where we are still

                using `iptables`.


                The new recipe relies on `meson` as a build system now.


                The .bbapend file that contains modifications specific to balena is preserved.

                Only `balena-client-id.patch` is removed as it references code that no longer

                exists. This is because the internal systemd DHCPv4 client code that NM used

                is now replaced by nettools' n-dhcp4 implementation.


                Closes #2872

                Current resolvconf version is broken for kirkstone, which is
                fixed upstream,

                so we reuse the fixed version from upstream.


                The symptom is that DNS servers provided by DHCP are not being used.

                        The `make subnet` command can be called on Jenkins and
                        similar to generate

                        a unique subnet that is not in use.


                        The DinD daemon in the core service will also start with a non-default

                        subnet.

                When unlocking LUKS devices, udev events initializing the DM
                devices are still

                generated in the background even after cryptsetup luksOpen returns. We need to

                wait for the udev processing to finish before killing udev and cleaning up

                the udev database to avoid having to deal with partially initialized devices

                or corrupted udev database in the target OS.

                In the current state the cryptsetup initrd script tries to
                unlock all

                LUKS volumes in the system using the TPM. This includes user-defined LUKS

                volumes that, if present, fail to unlock and make the system unbootable.

                We should also not touch user-defined volumes in the first place.


                This patch modifies the cryptsetup script to only unlock LUKS volumes

                that are on the OS drive (same block device as the EFI partition).

              hash: 795e2427821d28fcf894da1cba9afc245efc38b3
              body: >
                Partitions in flasher images are being created with different
                LABEL and

                PARTLABEL, for example:

                ```

                /dev/sdd2: LABEL="flash-rootA" UUID="5585296a-c183-4b10-89ae-20607e5604be" TYPE="ext4" PARTLABEL="resin-rootA" PARTUUID="582478f2-be4b-4279-9124-536385c9551d"

                ```


                This commit fixes the inconsistency as the PARTLABEL is used as a fallback

                method to identify devices.

              body: >
                Enabling CONFIG_KERNEL_ZSTD=y improves the compression ratio
                compared

                to gzip while being faster to decompress. With kernel 5.15 in balenaOS

                v2.105, we see the 24 MB kernel compress to approximately 19 MB.


                Zstd support was added in commit 48f7ddf, first introduced in kernel

                v5.9. Enable this config unconditionally in supported kernels.


                Note that not every architecture and device support this option, but in

                those cases, Kconfig will automatically disable it as HAVE_ZSTD is also

                missing.

                Generate a bmap file from the sparse image to allow for punching
                holes

                in the disk image ranges that were unmapped after building. This data is

                lost during compression, and the bmapfile allows for recreating,

                writing, and verifying the sparse image.

                        Hardcoding the bridge address like this results in conflicts

                        when multiple instances are running on one jenkins node.


                        A new solution for local workstation testing will have to be

                        considered.

                        on a 1 seconds interval,

                        let's reduce it to 30 times because the resolveLocalTarget which we call will

                        timeout too in 15 seconds:


                        https://github.com/balena-os/leviathan-worker/blob/master/lib/helpers/index.ts#L162


                        So reducing the retries number to 30 will effectly bring the total combined timeout to a maximum of 8 minutes.

                Given that testbot devices use a tunnel to specific ports to
                communicate

                with the DUT that is established with the suite-generated keys, using

                a different keypair for the ssh-auth test would require to tear down and

                re-establish the tunnel.


                It's easier to just use the existing key pair in the ssh-auth test.

                Using two set of keys, the one created by the suite to
                authenticate by

                the proxy and a new custom key, is tricky as when running on testbot the

                key is used to establish the tunnel between core and DUT.


                Revert this change in preparation to removing the custom key and

                modifying the tests to use a single key.


                This reverts commit b24d92774a67cf0c0b83a29848bdcf6ed8a574db.

                This commits works around it by allowing all members of the service's

                control group to send notification messages.

                `/root/id`

                which is created by the cloud suite to SSH via the proxy server, and

                a custom key stored in `/root/test_id` used in some of the subtests.


                Fix the test cases using the custom key to use the correct private key.

                The `os-config` application stops the supervisor before fetching
                openvpn

                configuration and starting the `openvpn` service unit.


                As the `openvpn` service units stops `os-config`, it might not get to

                restart the supervisor.


                This commit checks that `os-config` is not already active before

                starting it.


                Fixes #2855

                The sshd daemon is configured to fetch keys from the API for
                local

                sources balena-config-vars and is run as an exclusive non-root user.


                Let's set the correct permissions for this file to allow not to break

                the above.


                Also, add a test to check that the SSH authentication with user

                registered keys does not break again.

                Yocto builds will abort due to inconsistencies between the
                pseudo

                database and files modified outside of the pseudo context [0].


                This will occasionally cause builds to fail in the do_deploy step of the

                kernel-devsrc recipe. [1]


                Fix this by not removing the kernel_source tarball in the do_deploy

                step.

                Since kirkstone tasks have network access disabled by default so

                This config file hasn't been used since commit 2db88c2, which
                unified

                how managed and unmanaged images operate. Since that commit, openvpn

                starts up if the config file at /etc/openvpn/openvpn.conf is found, and

                otherwise remains inactive. This file is populated by os-config.


                Remove the old config to prevent misdirection and cleanup the layer.

                Chronyd checks that the directory specified as `sourcedir` in
                `chrony.conf`

                (in this case `/var/chrony`) is not world accessible if it exists (chrony

                will create it correctly if it does not exist), and does not start

                if that's the case.


                The way that the `/var/chrony` is created when it does not exist opens

                the possibility of the directory existing with the wrong permissions and

                hitting this problem.


                This commit creates the directory with the correct permissions from the

                start to avoid the race condition.


                It also changes the permissiong from 750 to 770 to match what chrony

                does (see

                support

                hostOS updates between aufs and overlay2 balenaOS versions.


                This commit adds support for 5.15 kernels and improves the branch

                selection logic to cover some corner cases.


                It also adds a test task so that we can test regressions.

                The move to include the ABI in the target definition was done in
                Poky:

                d6b563710e6cc0857843433d85023d47f9f2037d


                Without much explanation in the commit, the ABI was removed in Poky:

                e4c16d11128f0e9cc2567fc9e3579e9a94988b2e


                Only to be re-introduced, also without much explanation in Poky:

                0bf2fd16273436f1cd9ea2ab99ad882e879f965d


                Then, there was a partial revert to remove the ABI again in Poky:

                66ff1fb3a164fa794ee186960809e3fa9e938b48


                This last 66ff1fb3a164fa794ee186960809e3fa9e938b48 commit is reverted here as

                it fails to build for ARM targets. All our boards that cover all the

                possible ABIs build with this change.

                        Unfortunately the standalone balena-cli package is
                        linked to glibc

                        and does not work with musl (alpine) so we need to switch to debian.


                        The trade-off seems worth it for build times though.

                        is no longer part of the ndoe dependencies, but for now just

                        publish the current setting.

                Instead of querying devices w/ `fdisk -l`, glob match patterns
                specified

                in resin-init-flasher.conf with devices present in `/dev`. This allows us to

                specify devices like `hd? sd? mmcblk?` instead of individual device

                numbers, which don't consistently map to any particular disk.


                This also allows RAID arrays to be matched with the array name and a

                pattern that glob matches even arrays assembled automatically on a

                non-matching host, such as `md/balena?(_?)` matching an array named

                `balena` and assembled on-device at `/dev/md/balena_0`.

                These packages also install kernel images into the boot
                directory in the

                root partition, overwriting the initramfs kernel installed by

                kernel-image-initramfs.


                Before kirkstone, the way to not include the kernel image was to

                override the `RDEPENDS:${KERNEL_PACKAGE_NAME}-base` not to include

                `kernel-image`, as was done in the `kernel-resin-noimage` class.


                Kirkstone changes the dependency from RDEPENDS to RRECOMMENDS in

                Poky's commit f6d963fa6d0e64d53f7ef56fd2c12d67f5811829


                Now excluding the kernel image needs to `PACKAGE_EXCLUDE = "kernel-image-*"`

                The crate fetcher was introduced in bitbake in Kirkstone, before

                it was living in meta-rust.


                We want to use the balena-rust layer across a wide variety of Yocto

                versions so include the fetcher conditionally.

                The arch_to_rust_arch() function was introduced to cater for
                ppc64le

                systems and is not present in older Yocto releases.


                This commit reverts to the previous way of setting the rust architecture.

                It will not work for ppc64le and if we would need to support such an

                architecture the arch_to_rust_arch() function will still be called if it

                exists in Kirkstone or newer Yocto versions.

                a set of dependencies that work for all of our rust applications across

                the 1.32 to 1.62 toolchain versions that are supported across all the

                Yocto versions we keep compatibility with.


                This layer allows to set a preferred version as a distro setting that can

                be used across all Yocto versions.


                These rust recipes come from Poky Kirkstone

              body: >
                Previously, our healthcheck verified if we were able to start a
                new

                container. This had two downsides:


                1. It was relatively heavyweight. In devices under heavy load, it would
                   sometimes take so long to run that the Engine was killed by the
                   watchdog.
                2. It wrote to the storage media. Creating a container involves writing
                   some data to persistent storage, therefore the healthcheck was
                   wearing the storage media.

                This new healthcheck simply pings both `balenad` and `containerd`, which

                is much faster than starting a new container and doesn't write to disk.

                The step of pinging `containerd` is important because we have seen at

                least one case in the past in which `balenad` was working but

                `containerd` wasn't.

                With `WatchdogSignal=SIGTERM` systemd will send a SIGTERM and
                give the

                Engine 90 seconds to gracefully shutdown before sending a SIGKILL. We

                had cases of Engine metadata on disk getting corrupted after the

                watchdog sent it a SIGKILL directly. This change shall minimize this

                issue.

                Our tests perform two HUPs (into and out of the release under
                test), and

                the code for both of these HUPs were duplicated. This commit factors

                this code out to a common function.

                This is a small improvement over our previous test: in addition
                to

                checking that the volumes themselves are preserved over HUPs, we now

                check if the contents of these volumes is preserved.


                Resolves #2428

                The boot partition is currently a FAT filesystem that does not
                support

                atomic writes. To prevent corruption, this commit introduces a fatrw

                application that needs to be used both when reading and writing files

                to the boot partition to provide safe accesses.

                        The executeCommand family of methods default to retrying
                        on failure. In

                        some cases, such as in the ssh-auth test in the cloud test suite, we

                        expect failures to happen, and want them to be raised immediately. Other

                        situations might demand adjusting the number of retries and interval to

                        fit specific tests. Add a retryOptions object to these methods to allow

                        for this behavior to be configured.

                By creating empty configuration units when no configuratin is
                applied to

                a service instead we avoid regenerating them at boot if stored in

                persistent memory helping with boot times in less powerful devices.

                This allows for specific devices to override the defaults, which
                is to

                store configuration units on volatile memory re-generating them every

                boot and avoiding storage media writes.


                Changing this to permanent storage trades boot times with media life

                expectancy.

                Currently `os-config-json` is also parsing `units-conf.json` at
                runtime.

                This is expensive to do for smaller devices, so this commit performs the

                processing at build time.


                For this, it also splits the configuration units processing in

                balena-config-vars into its own recipe to allow for task ordering.

                Executing balena-config-vars is quite taxing for smaller
                devices. For

                example a RaspberryPi Zero.


                This commit introduces a cached memory file with the configuration

                environment that is recreated when `config.json` changes and will be

                used if present.

                When parallelizing fingerprint checks with Promise.any(), the

                unsuccessful command would continue retrying in the background, causing

                spurious error messages.


                With mDNS resolution memoization, this optimization no longer saves us

                time, so remove it.

                When accessing a test device as part of a fleet, a cloud API key
                is

                required in order to generate an SSH key and access the device through

                the VPN. However, when accessing a device locally, such as a QEMU

                instance running on the workstation itself, we have a direct path, and

                no VPN is necessary.


                Make the apiKey optional, and don't login when it's not specified. This

                allows direct connections to work without it.

                We may have cases when for some boards we do not want

                to have all these files blacklisted. See for example

                https://github.com/balena-os/balena-rockpi/commit/b5eadcfb3a296eea2554dc0cbdd16002d51c5169


                In conclusion, we rework how the blacklist is constructed

                so that users of meta-balena can alter this list as they see fit.

                This changes the condition in the unit file from checking
                whether

                /dev/disk/by-state/balena-efi exists to checking whether /mnt/boot/EFI

                is a symlink. The original approach has a race condition populating

                the by-state symlink - it is depending on udev and if the link is

                not present when the service is started (after the boot partition is mounted),

                the service fails and the EFI partition is never mounted.


                The new approach does the trick pretty well - /mnt/boot/EFI is a symlink

                if the EFI partition is split and a regular directory in case there is a single

                boot partition. That said the service is only started when necessary

                and the waiting for udev is implemented as a part of the mount script.

                Recent versions of GRUB default to use shim_lock when in secure

                We do not use shim and do not build the shim_lock module into GRUB EFI binary

                therefore this needs to be disabled.

                Add a healthcheck that will check that the NTP sources are
                reachable

                and the system time does not skew.


                The healthcheck will command a burst sync if there is no selected

                reachable source, and will restart chronyd if the system clock skews.


                Fixes #2314

                30s interval before trying again. Reduce this to a 5s interval w/

                When tests execute quicker, a race condition can occur where
                config.json

                is edited to remove the dnsServers property, but /run/dnsmasq.servers is

                not changed yet. This causes the test to fail, as the file is not empty.

                    not ok 1 - We should have an empty /run/dnsmasq.servers file.
                      ---
                      found: |-

                	+"server=1.1.1.1\nserver=1.1.1.1"

                Fix this by waiting until the InvocationID of dnsmasq.service changes.

                        The root cause of this issue was an integer overflow in
                        32-bit platforms

                        -- specifically, when explicitly converting `io.Reader` offsets

                        (`int64`) to slice indices (`int`, which is only 32-bit long on 32-bit

                        platforms).


                        We already had in place the checks supposed to ensure slice bounds where

                        always within the expected bounds. So, in a way, this commit just

                        re-organizes the code so that we perform safely this required `int64` to

                        `int` type conversion.

                and iwlwifi-quz-a0-jf-b0 to include compressed firmware files. Without it

                the packages end up empty as we have compression enabled.

                        valid png during

                        the write step. This could prevent the device from provisioning if some

                        corruption happens at some point.

                        This commit updates all backends that write to /mnt/boot
                        to do it

                        through a new `lib/host-utils` module. Writes are now done using write +

                        sync as rename is not an atomic operation in vfat.


                        The change also applies for writes through the `/v1/host-config`

                        endpoint.


                        Finally this change includes some improvements on tests.

                        The status field does not indicate the current state of
                        the Engine on the device.

                        Rather, it only indicates whether the HTTP response returned successfully or not.


                        To get the current state of the device, i.e. whether it has applied target state or not,

                        use the `appState` field in the response.

                        The linked issue describes the Supervisor not cleaning
                        up locks it creates due

                        to crashing at just the wrong time. After internal discussion we decided to

                        differentiate Supervisor-created lockfiles from user-created lockfiles by using

                        the `nobody` UID (65534) for Supervisor-created lockfiles.


                        As the existing NPM lockfile lib does not allow creating lockfiles atomically

                        with different UIDs, we move to using the lockfile binary, which is part of the

                        procmail package. To allow nonroot users to write to lock directories, permissions

                        are changed to allow write access by nonroot users.

                        Migration `M00008` had a bug with the check for legacy
                        apps, which

                        resulted in devices that had at some point been updated from a single

                        container supervisor to get the error


                        ```

                        Undefined binding(s) detected when compiling UPDATE. Undefined column(s): [appUuid] query

                        ```


                        This adds a new migration with the fix to ensure broken fix the

                        inconsistent database state.

                        will need to be restarted on supervisor update

              body: >
                This reverts 5047757 where we set the global DHCP timeout for
                ipv4 to

                infinity to mitigate problems with routers that do not respond to DHCP

                requests in time.


                This however causes issues on some routers, which after power cycle fail to

                renew leases after they are expired.


                The same ipv4.dhcp-timeout can be specified on per connection basis. Since

                the case with lease renewal due to router power cycle is a more common case,

                it is better to keep the global dhcp-timeout default unmodified. If the

                setting needs adjustment then it can be overwritten in the particular

                connection profile.

              body: >
                There are known situations in which balenaEngine times out
                during

                initialization (for example, during aufs to overlayfs migrations, or

                when restarting a device that was running a large number of containers).

                When these time outs occur, Systemd kills the Engine, causing further

                problems.


                To avoid these cases, this commit disables timeouts during the Engine

                initialization.


                This is also aligned with the default Systemd settings distributed with

                the Moby project.

                        This adds two new integration tests:


                        * TestDeltaSize: this is meant to catch regressions on delta sizes. It
                          generates deltas and compare their sizes with the delta sizes we get
                          as of now. If the size increases, the test fails.
                        * TestDeltaCorrectness: checks if applying a delta indeed results in the
                          same image as we had originally.

                        A number of different test cases (different images with distinct

                        features) are tested for each of these integration tests.

                Let's ensure tools like fixdep are built in container
                and not reused from the yocto build, otherwise they
                may not run if they were linked against a different
                version of libc that may not be available in the kernel
                modules build container.

                This fixes the following error encountered when doing
                a Poky Honister build for the balena-intel repository:

                This was originally introduced in combination with a kernel
                patch backported

                from Red Hat kernel that would enable kernel lockdown when secure boot

                is enabled. We have since changed the approach, dropped the kernel patch

                and when in secure boot mode use a different GRUB config file that enables

                lockdown on kernel command line unconditionally.


                That said, while the patch works fine, we do not really need it and it adds

                extra overhead porting it to newer yocto versions so there is no point keeping

                it at this moment. If in the future there is need for the kernel to know

                whether it is in secure boot mode or not, we can roll this back and rebase.

                In most cases there is not enough space on rootfs to extract

                and load a local hostapp image when the balena-host tmpdir

                is on the same partition.


                This uses a data mount to ensure temporary extracted files of the

                compressed image will not fill the target sysroot.

                Under certain circumstances that we haven't reproduced,

                it is reported that the alternate GPT may become corrupt,

                preventing the device from booting.


                Should this happen, we use sgdisk to check and recover the end gpt

                from the main one.

                This caters for the use case of custom device types that are not

                registered in balena-cloud but still need to fetch the supervisor from

                balena-cloud's registry by querying the `supervisor_version` endpoint,

                for example when using openBalena.

                managed

                by the API.


                Providing the image name in the command line provides an update path

                for unmanaged devices, manual updates on ESR devices (which currently

                do not allow dashboard based updates) and openBalena use cases.

                The issue that this test is aimed at has been introduced in

                kernel versions above 4.13. On older kernels like for instance

                4.9, the test will not pass.


                Let's run this test on kernel versions where the issue was present.

                https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/commit/1eee36a5520b5a89fb4d0d6af6f9cb0217a3164f

                was merged and included in kernel versions after 5.10.84,

                building the kernel-modules-headers fails due to various missing

                headers from the gmp and mpc packages. This problem is visible

                only after upgrading to a newer kernel, because until now the

                gcc plugins kernel config was not enabled at all, due to the

                failed check in the above mentioned patch.


                Since we are not using the functions provided

                by the gcc plugins anyway, we can disable this

                config.

                In the current state the by-state symlink for balena-efi
                partition

                is not generated for two reasons:

                - 60-resin-update-state.rules only react to resin-* partition names

                - the root device is not identified correctly in resin_update_state_probe
                  for LUKS devices

                This patch fixes both the issues and makes use of the by-state symlink

                instead of by-label.

            - subject: Add PCR protection policy to TPM operation unlocking LUKS passphrase
              hash: aa76a9b45e18192ecaa67f17ef68f9cfc4d66a66
              body: >
                This patch adds the check for PCRs

                - 0 - firmware/UEFI blob

                - 1 - firmware/UEFI config

                - 2 - Expansion card firmware blobs

                - 3 - Expansion card firmware configs


                The full protection is only applied on first boot after provisioning,

                flasher only locks against PCRs 0, 2 and 3.

                This is because when using flasher, the environment is not in the same

                state as the one we want to lock to. In particular the boot order is

                different (flasher is booted from a different drive than the resulting OS).

                As for now we were not able to find a better solution than fully locking

                only on first boot. This means the device must be booted in a secure

                environment at least once after provisioning.

                        The moby engine v20.x.y adds some selinux [security
                        configurations](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration)

                        depending on the [container configuration](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/daemon/create.go#L214).

                        This would cause the supervisor to enter a service restart loop as the

                        current and target service configurations will never match. The

                        supervisor now ignores selinux specific security options since those are

                        not supported by balenaOS.

                        Also adds cases for this to the unit and integration tests of the

                        migrator.

                        This commit changes the way we retry layer downloads
                        after failures with

                        the goal of making it more resilient, especially for cases involving

                        large layers and unreliable network connections.


                        These are the changes:


                        * Make sure we also retry after failures in `v2LayerDescriptor.reset()`.
                          This method creates a new HTTP request to resume a failed download,
                          and therefore depends on a working network to succeed.
                        * Wait exponentially longer times between retries (instead of retrying
                          immediately as before). This shall increase of success in case of
                          network issues that take longer to get resolved.
                        * Increase the number of retries to 10.

                        * Reset retry count whenever we successfully download anything at all.
                          The idea is that we want to give up downloading only after a long
                          continuous period of failures. Combined with the exponential back-off
                          strategy and increased number of retries described above, a layer pull
                          will fail only after about 17 minutes.
                        * Add a bit more logging to help with troubleshooting.

                        If the engine process is terminated during the layer
                        extraction transaction,

                        before Commit or Cancel is called on the transaction, a new FS layer can be created

                        by the graph driver without any link to the layers metadata.


                        This change ensures we don't perform any actions on the graph driver storage until

                        the FS layer ID (the cacheID) is  persisted as a part of the transaction data.


                        We can use this data to clean up the graph driver storage on next process start

                        deleting all data associated with the transactions terminated abruptly.

                The prepare-openvpn service needs to be restarted to regenerate
                the

                VPN keys when provisioning is finished and the `apiKey` is removed.


                Note that flasher images make changes to `/mnt/boottmp/config.json` so

                we still need to manually kick `prepare-openvpn` in

                `resin-device-register`, which is preferable to modifying services to

                watch multiple paths.

                This might also resolve a race condition that has been difficult to

                track down.

                Upstream kernel added a new fkms overlay for
                the Pi4 and CM4 and switched to using it
                from overlay-map, however, we were not aware
                of this.

                Let's add a vcdbg testcase to warn in case the RPi
                firmware fails to load any overlay or dtb, and set
                gpu_mem to 64 so that vcdbg can run.

              hash: 13cf7c9fef0a6e0df6b042ba34ceaa7a0d005254
              body: >
                We want the VPN to start unconditionally even if the
                connectivity URL

                is not reachable.


                The rationale for adding the dependency in the first place was that

                without an initial timesync certificate checks may fail. This can still

                happen, but the VPN will retry continuously and eventually succeed once

                the time is synched.


                What happens now is that the VPN is delayed until the http sync, so if

                the connectivity URL is blocked or unreachable, but the internet is

                accessible, VPN will not even launch and no remote debugging is possible.


                Fixes #2508

                When config.json is written, use the config.json unit
                configuration to create

                per-unit configuration files extracts.


                These will then be monitored by the respective service units to trigger

                restarts, so that service units will only be restarted when there are

                configuration changes that apply to them.

                Unit files that are configured via config.json and want to be
                restarted

                on config.json changes are part of this target.


                This causes a burst of service restarts each time config.json changes,

                independently of whether the configuration changes applies to the unit

                or not.


                This commit removes all config-json.target instances in preparation for

                the introduction of a better, more fine grained mechanism.

                to use a custom stage2 bootloader. Since that is not ready yet, emulate that

                by copying flasher kernel to the EFI partition, start it from GRUB, have it

                unlock all the partitions, find the real kernel and kexec into it.

                We add this this check since we discovered
                that with newer boot firmware the Pi4 will
                not reboot when under-voltage is reported.

                We don't mark the test as failed in
                this case, since there may be devices that
                continue to work even if under-powered and we
                don't want to block or delay development if the
                DUT is remote and cannot be checked or replaced
                easily.

                This check provides an indication for further
                debugging of failed test cases.

                Let's only apply this code to pre-warrior as intended. Starting
                with warrior this code is in poky so we can rely on it from
                there instead of keeping a duplicate in meta-balena-common.
                This helps with BSPs that may define their own tasks (configure,
                compile and so on) for u-boot (keeping this fragments merging
                code in meta-balena-common would have the effect of overwriting
                these tasks from here and thus breaking the build).

                jq is used in the bootfiles hostapp-update
                hook for accessing config.json, which may have
                one of the modification dates invalid,
                as we've seen during testing. We thus need to
                avoid performing a touch on config.json
                to avoid reloading of containers.

              body: >
                The chrony driftfile is not being updated at shutdown due to an

                incorrect mount service dependency in the systemd chronyd.service

                file. The current dependency on 'var-volatile-lib' does not cover the

                subsequent bind mounting of the '/var/lib/chrony' sub-directory, so

                the chrony directory gets unmounted at shutdown before the drift file

                has been updated.


                This issue is solved by changing the mount service dependency from

                'var-volatile-lib' to 'bind-var-lib-chrony' (which is similar to the

                way bind mount dependencies are already handled for the NetworkManager

                and bluetooth services).

                Newer ones should prefer v1.54, which is the latest rust
                version to use the Honister syntax.

                cleanedup as the rules between initramfs and rootfs might defer.


                However, dm devices are flagged not to be re-processed, so we need to

                set a sticky bit on them so they persist the cleanup.

                From v2.49, the hostapp-update utility creates the /run
                directory in the

                root filesystem, however when huping from previous versions /run is not

                there.


                Commit bab3cd7f50022127bfef50fde9cd445b6b55a7b2 switches to use /tmp

                to store the new UUID for the root partition on first boot after

                generating new UUIDs as this is backwards compatible.


                However, this means that the udev database in the initramfs is recreated

                on the final system instead of reused. This becomes a problems for DM

                devices (used in luks based disk encryption), as they are not re-processed

                by udevd.


                This change will use /run if available, so new releases that may implement

                disk encryption work, or /tmp if not so it still remains backwards

                compatible for HUP from older releases.

                Some BSPs name the u-boot such as u-boot-imx_2020 for example.
                Because of that, our existing bbappend called u-boot_%.bbappend
                will not match it and will fail to be applied.
                This PR is a first pass at solving this by moving at least the
                SRC_URI appending part from this bbappend and into the
                resin-u-boot.bbclass instead. Further investigation is needed
                to see if we can remove this bbappend altogether since we may
                have all boards using Poky Warrior or newer, making this
                u-boot bbappend obsolete.

                The CM4 IO-Board was the first device
                which exhibited an issue in which
                the MAC address was set to an
                unprogrammed value AA:AA:AA...:AA.

                We've addressed this in the device repo,
                meanwhile it has been fixed in upstream
                too, so let's check and catch this should
                it happen again.

                anymore therefore we can safely remove it.

                This patch replaces the kernel being shipped with the one that
                we eventually

                sign for EFI - without signing the original file used would be identical

                but after applying signature, the signed version is the one we want to ship.


                It also fixes the file name for the detached signature, which must match

                the name of the associated file.

              hash: 2bb18707557979ed6466f45602de4ecf5b386c57
              body: >
                Add a new timesync-https systemd service to synchronise the
                system

                time at boot using an HTTPS header. The service uses curl to request

                an HTTPS header from either $API_ENDPOINT/connectivity-check (default)

                or the URL defined by the os.network.connectivity.uri field in

                config.json. The URL used *must* return HTTP code 204 (No Content)

                in response to a request so that we can determine that we have full

                network connectivity and are not operating behind a captive portal.


                The date field returned by a valid header is used to set the current

                system time. The date/time derived from the header is assumed to be a

                reasonable source of 'truth' such that it can be used to adjust the

                system time both backwards and forwards. This will compensate for any

                erroneous timestamps saved via fake-hwclock or any invalid data

                read from an RTC.


                The service will exit when a valid response has been received. Poll

                attempts will be made at an increasing interval starting at 2s and

                doubling up to a maximum of 64s. Polling will continue at the maximum

                interval until a valid response has been received.


                This service will provide initial time synchronisation for devices

                where NTP ports have been blocked. For devices where NTP access is

                available it should ensure that any system 'time jump' is only a few

                seconds when NTP synchronisation is eventually achieved. It also

                allows other services to start with a reasonably accurate time

                without having to wait for the NTP synchronisation process to

                complete.


                Services that are ordered after the new time-sync-https-wait target

                can be sure that full network connectivity has been achieved and that

                time has been synchronised with an accuracy of a few seconds.

                When udev runs resin_update_state_probe for a non-balena
                partition

                and ENV{ID_PART_ENTRY_NAME} is undefined it still gets expanded to random

                garbage accidentally lying at the eventual memory address. This can create

                a mess in /dev/disk/by-state e.g. when external devices are connected.

                The interface test uses a simple ping to ensure a specific
                interface

                works. It sends ten packets, and expects ten packets back. However, the

                default interval is one second, which increases the time taken for the

                test while not adding anything of value.


                Reduce the timeout to the minimum non-privileged interval of 2ms.

                The hook tries to read EFI variables from efivarfs but this is
                not always

                mounted within the container. We have already validated that we are running

                in EFI mode therefore we can just check whether it is already mounted

                and eventually mount with no further checks.


                This also adds graceful handling of nonexistent variables since not all

                UEFI implementations come with secure boot support.

                At this moment GRUB drops to rescue shell if config is invalid

                or if signatures are missing/wrong. This lets the user disable the signature

                checks altogether.


                With this patch GRUB outputs nothing and accepts no user input if signing

                is configured.

                approach and we will look for a clean solution.

                GRUB can not use the TPM easily to unlock the volumes and find
                the kernel

                on an encrypted partition. Instead, we choose to store a linux kernel

                and use it as 2nd stage bootloader to unlock the partition, load the actual

                kernel and kexec into it. This should eventually be replaced by a proper

                2nd stage bootloader that is being worked on.

                Currently the two classes would keep the original files
                untouched and store

                the signed versions as .signed. This patch reverses the logic - the signed

                files replace the original ones and the unsigned version is stored as .unsigned.

                This is because there is no real use-case for the unsigned files, we always

                want to ship the signed version, even if the particular DT does not require it,

                this causes no harm.

                possible to HUP

                to an unsigned version of the OS because UEFI would refuse to boot it before

                any of our self-recovering rollback mechanisms can be triggered. This would

                effectively brick the device, needing physical access to recover.

              hash: 07dbe414a1dfa556427d4fc94ce7fdec688cf0e2

                Previously, the core service exposed a /proxy endpoint that
                would start

                up a proxy remotely, which would be used by a test in the connectivity

                module. However, the endpoint returned the address for the testbot to be

                used as the proxy in the response, and this required manual

                configuration of the interface. Additionally, it requires the worker

                service to install and provide glider for forward proxying.


                Move the proxy (glider) to a container on the device being tested,

                which simplifies configuration, and reduces the complexity and size of

                the interface of Leviathan.

                Add a test to wait for the chronyd service to become active
                before

                starting the time sync tests.


                The current chronyd tests assume that the chronyd service is

                instantly available at boot time. With the addition of the new

                HTTPS time synchronisation service the starting of chronyd can be

                delayed by a few seconds so we need to ensure that the service

                is actually running before proceeding.

                but is not part of the root filesystem generation.


                The decoupling allows to build just the docker rootfs image without

                having to build the balenaos-img target.

                by users or by power supplys when booting into the new OS,
                during HUP.

                When the limit is reached, u-boot will proceed to try
                to boot into the old OS.

                The Rock Pi 4B uses a file named hw_intf.conf for
                enabling/disabling interfaces and for loading overlays.
                Just noting that the syntax is also slightly different
                from the config.txt file on RaspberryPi.

                Let's blacklist this file to avoid overriding
                it during an OS update.

                When user namespacing was enabled in the kernel by default, a
                separate

                commit [0] was introduced to disable the feature at runtime, to allow

                users/administrators to explicitly choose to enable it, avoiding

                potential security implications.


                However, some applications such as Chromium's sandbox, require either

                SUID or user namespacing to work. Disabling this feature on boards

                that previously enabled it necessitates container modifications and

                potentially breaks previously working applications.


                Create a distro feature to disable user namespacing by default in

                meta-balena, while allowing device types to keep it enabled to maintain

                compatibility with their original behavior.

                the /device-types/v1 endpoint is deprecated and we can remove
                the logo from the device repos so we can also stop handling it
                from here. Instead, the logo will be used from the hw contracts.

                For the time being we are still using a version label in the hostapp.

        the bootcount environment variable to hex when
        the environment is updated, and then bootcount comparison
        fails during the next boot because it cannot compare numbers
        that use different bases.

        fatwrite command can fail under
        specific circumstances, like for
        instance when there were around
        20 files in the filesystem. This
        was caused by an incorrect cast.

        We backport a patch from upstream
        to avoid potential failure to boot
        after HUP, when bootcount is saved
        to the FAT partition.

        Failure log:
            Error Invalid FAT entry 0x3ffffffa

                The previous commit moved the preloaded image out of yocto
                cache, which

                made it unreachable from the balena-generate-ami-env container.


                This patch makes mktemp create the file back within yocto cache to ensure

                this is shared yet still each concurrent process can safely have its own copy.

                Since the file name is hardcoded at this moment, this fails when
                two

                builds are running in parallel (e.g. dev and prod variants during deploy)

                because they try to preload the same file at pretty much the same moment.

                Having a separate copy for each outside of yocto cache should fix the issue.

                At runtime we can now enable development features that were
                previously

                configured using the development-image feature. That feature also

                configured U-Boot for OS development.


                Now we have two distinct functionalities:


                * A runtime development configuration variable that configures the

                device to facilitate application development

                * A build time osdev-image feature that configures the OS for BSP and OS

                development


                This allows us to merge the current production/development images into

                a single image.

                BalenaHUP won't need to transfer the isolcpus setting to

                the new OS anymore. This is necessary only when updating from older

                OS versions in which the supervisor adds the isolcpus

                setting to the boot partition extlinux.conf file.

                Some OS versions before HUP do not support the '-b all' flag
                to journalctl. This commit reverts to the original behaviour
                that lists the boots and requests the logs for each boot.

                        In these cases we want to avoid restarting the same services

                        manually from the supervisor.

                        PR #1749 introduced a bug when pushing local target
                        state. An update to

                        the [image name normalization](https://github.com/balena-os/balena-supervisor/blob/f1bd4b8d9bcef29e326cbf97eaddd837c2704d19/src/lib/docker-utils.ts#L81)

                        failed to consider the local image name format. This results in mangling

                        of image names in the database, i.e. the image `ubuntu:latest` is stored

                        as `/ubuntu:latest`. This causes an exception to be returned by the

                        dockerode `getImage('/ubuntu:latest').inspect()` call.


                        This sends the supervisor into a crash loop and is shown on the supervisor

                        journal logs as


                        ```

                        getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND images
                            at GetAddrInfoReqWrap.onlookup [as oncomplete] (dns.js:64:26)
                        ```


                        Unfortunately if this happens on a user device, since the mangled image

                        name is already on the database, the easiest way to fix is to remove the

                        supervisor database and let the supervisor recreate it. Deleting the

                        database should be side effect free.

                        dependent ids optional and rely on using general UUIDs and user known identifiers

                        for comparison. This PR moves forward in that direction by removing some of those

                        comparisons for v2 target state.


                        - imageId to be replaced with imageName

                        - releaseId to be replaced by commit (future release_uuid)


                        This is a backwards compatible change, meaning it doesn't completely get rid of

                        these identifiers (which are still being used by supervisor API and for state

                        patch), but will not depend on those identifiers for calculating steps to target state.

                        The image manager module now uses tags instead of docker
                        IDs as the main

                        way to identify docker images on the engine. That is, if the target

                        state image has a name `imageName:tag@digest`, the supervisor will always use

                        the given `imageName` and `tag` (which may be empty) to tag the image on

                        the engine after fetching. This PR also adds checkups to ensure

                        consistency is maintained between the database and the engine.


                        Using tags allows to simplify query and removal operations, since now

                        removing the image now means removing tags matching the image name.


                        Before this change the supervisor relied only on information in the

                        supervisor database, and used that to remove images by docker ID. However, the docker

                        id is not a reliable identifier, since images retain the same id between

                        releases or between services in the same release.

                        The previous module was using `rewire` to get the knex

                        db module but that was leading to issues when running tests using `test:fast`.

                        This provides a fix for the test module that just removes the destroy

                        call entirely (it turns out it is not necessary).

                Fix a race condition that can occur when setting the hostname at

                boot by disabling NetworkManager's ability to modify the hostname.

                The static and transient system hostnames are now managed exclusively

                by the 'balena-hostname' service.

                variable is only available after the kernel has been built as it relies

                generated. This function parses the Makefile so only needs the source.

                Currently 'chronyc onoffline' is run for 'up/down' events on any

                'connectivity-change' events as we are really interested in whether

                the internet is there or not rather than whether an interface is

                up or down.

                Most major distributions now ship kernels with user namespacing
                enabled

                in the kernel config. Some distributions, such as Arch and Ubuntu,

                default to the upstream behavior of allowing unprivileged user

                namespacing, regardless of potential attack surfaces exposed in the

                kernel.


                Other distributions, such as Debian, are slightly more conservative,

                disabling the feature at runtime behind a sysctl tunable. Debian

                maintains its own patch to add the kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone

                tunable.


                The Debian patch was rejected by upstream over fears of application

                developers not using this feature due to it being generally unavailable

                in systems, as well as fears of bugs going undiscovered.


                RHEL uses a newer tunable introduced upstream to set the max number of

                user namespaces to zero, which accomplishes the same thing, but without

                an out of tree patch.


                Disable user namespacing at runtime using the same method as RHEL, in

                the same manner as the hardened kernels and distributions have chosen.

                introduced when images including
                8227a61f6bef6d93cc6a5acd0ef93a2012079964

                made it to production.

                We can now use a runtime drop-in unit placed under /run/systemd/ to

                configure the balena-host service, which doesn't require us to remount

                the rootfs.

                Triggered by a failue in the VPN test - the bash binary is
                bigger than

                the openvpn binary and on devices with limitted rootfs space the copying

                is not possible. Symlinking /dev/null will break the services as well.

                Having the lines limited to 500 meant we were missing
                a lot of logs.

                We also don't need to list boots and can use the 'all'
                arguement to see all logs.
