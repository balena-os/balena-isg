                jenkins_generate_ami.sh: Use a shared directory for preloaded
                image
              hash: 9b032f2fddc970db13147b4e637abd1bada1f234
              body: >
                The previous commit moved the preloaded image out of yocto
                cache, which

                made it unreachable from the balena-generate-ami-env container.


                This patch makes mktemp create the file back within yocto cache
                to ensure

                this is shared yet still each concurrent process can safely have
                its own copy.

                Since the file name is hardcoded at this moment, this fails when
                two

                builds are running in parallel (e.g. dev and prod variants
                during deploy)

                because they try to preload the same file at pretty much the
                same moment.

                Having a separate copy for each outside of yocto cache should
                fix the issue.

                At runtime we can now enable development features that were
                previously

                configured using the development-image feature. That feature
                also

                configured U-Boot for OS development.


                Now we have two distinct functionalities:


                * A runtime development configuration variable that configures
                the

                device to facilitate application development

                * A build time osdev-image feature that configures the OS for
                BSP and OS

                development


                This allows us to merge the current production/development
                images into

                a single image.

                other OS development like board bringup.

                the new OS anymore. This is necessary only when updating from
                older

                OS versions in which the supervisor adds the isolcpus

                setting to the boot partition extlinux.conf file.

                        automatically when the associated config files are

                        In these cases we want to avoid restarting the same
                        services

                        manually from the supervisor.

                      body: >
                        PR #1749 introduced a bug when pushing local target
                        state. An update to

                        the [image name
                        normalization](https://github.com/balena-os/balena-supervisor/blob/f1bd4b8d9bcef29e326cbf97eaddd837c2704d19/src/lib/docker-utils.ts#L81)

                        failed to consider the local image name format. This
                        results in mangling

                        of image names in the database, i.e. the image
                        `ubuntu:latest` is stored

                        as `/ubuntu:latest`. This causes an exception to be
                        returned by the

                        dockerode `getImage('/ubuntu:latest').inspect()` call.


                        This sends the supervisor into a crash loop and is shown
                        on the supervisor

                        journal logs as


                        ```

                        getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND images
                            at GetAddrInfoReqWrap.onlookup [as oncomplete] (dns.js:64:26)
                        ```


                        Unfortunately if this happens on a user device, since
                        the mangled image

                        name is already on the database, the easiest way to fix
                        is to remove the

                        supervisor database and let the supervisor recreate it.
                        Deleting the

                        database should be side effect free.

                        for comparison. This PR moves forward in that direction
                        by removing some of those

                        comparisons for v2 target state.

                        This is a backwards compatible change, meaning it

                        calculating steps to target state.

                      hash: f1bd4b8d9bcef29e326cbf97eaddd837c2704d19
                      body: >
                        The image manager module now uses tags instead of docker
                        IDs as the main

                        way to identify docker images on the engine. That is, if
                        the target

                        state image has a name `imageName:tag@digest`, the
                        supervisor will always use

                        the given `imageName` and `tag` (which may be empty) to
                        tag the image on

                        the engine after fetching. This PR also adds checkups to
                        ensure

                        consistency is maintained between the database and the
                        engine.


                        Using tags allows to simplify query and removal
                        operations, since now

                        removing the image now means removing tags matching the
                        image name.


                        Before this change the supervisor relied only on
                        information in the

                        supervisor database, and used that to remove images by
                        docker ID. However, the docker

                        id is not a reliable identifier, since images retain the
                        same id between

                        releases or between services in the same release.

                        The previous module was using `rewire` to get the knex
                        instance from the

                        db module but that was leading to issues when running
                        tests using `test:fast`.

                        This provides a fix for the test module that just
                        removes the destroy

                        call entirely (it turns out it is not necessary).

                Some kernel configuration are only applicable from specific
                kernel

                versions. This commit adds a function that allows to add a
                specific

                configuration set only from a given kernel version.

                This allows to re-use this functionality. Note that the
                `KERNEL_VERSION`

                variable is only available after the kernel has been built as it
                relies

                on get_kernelversion_headers() poky function and utsrelease.h
                being

                generated. This function parses the Makefile so only needs the
                source.

                Change the NetworkManager NTP dispatcher script to update the

                on/offline status of the NTP sources on 'connectivity-change'
                events

                instead of 'up/down' events.


                Currently 'chronyc onoffline' is run for 'up/down' events on any

                network interface. It makes more sense to run it for

                'connectivity-change' events as we are really interested in
                whether

                the internet is there or not rather than whether an interface is

                up or down.

                Most major distributions now ship kernels with user namespacing
                enabled

                in the kernel config. Some distributions, such as Arch and
                Ubuntu,

                default to the upstream behavior of allowing unprivileged user

                namespacing, regardless of potential attack surfaces exposed in
                the

                kernel.


                Other distributions, such as Debian, are slightly more
                conservative,

                disabling the feature at runtime behind a sysctl tunable. Debian

                maintains its own patch to add the
                kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone

                tunable.


                The Debian patch was rejected by upstream over fears of
                application

                developers not using this feature due to it being generally
                unavailable

                in systems, as well as fears of bugs going undiscovered.


                RHEL uses a newer tunable introduced upstream to set the max
                number of

                user namespaces to zero, which accomplishes the same thing, but
                without

                an out of tree patch.


                Disable user namespacing at runtime using the same method as
                RHEL, in

                the same manner as the hardened kernels and distributions have
                chosen.

                Having the lines limited to 500 meant we were missing
                a lot of logs.

                We also don't need to list boots and can use the 'all'
                arguement to see all logs.
